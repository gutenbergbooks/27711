<h2 class="chapter">PREFACE TO FIRST EDITION</h2>


<p>We must ask pardon of the public for offering it this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>

book, and give it due warning of what it will find
therein.</p>

<p>The public loves fictitious novels! this is a true novel.</p>

<p>It loves books which make a pretence of introducing
their readers to fashionable society: this book deals
with the life of the street.</p>

<p>It loves little indecent books, memoirs of courtesans,
alcove confessions, erotic obscenity, the scandal tucked
away in pictures in a bookseller's shop window: that
which is contained in the following pages is rigidly
clean and pure. Do not expect the photograph of
Pleasure <i>décolletée</i>: the following study is the clinic of
Love.</p>

<p>Again, the public loves to read pleasant, soothing
stories, adventures that end happily, imaginative works
that disturb neither its digestion nor its peace of mind:
this book furnishes entertainment of a melancholy, violent
sort calculated to disarrange the habits and injure
the health of the public.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></p>

<p>Why then have we written it? For no other purpose
than to annoy the public and offend its tastes?</p>

<p>By no means.</p>

<p>Living as we do in the nineteenth century, in an age
of universal suffrage, of democracy, of liberalism, we
asked ourselves the question whether what are called
"the lower classes" had no rights in the novel; if that
world beneath a world, the common people, must needs
remain subject to the literary interdict, and helpless
against the contempt of authors who have hitherto
said no word to imply that the common people possess
a heart and soul. We asked ourselves whether, in these
days of equality in which we live, there are classes
unworthy the notice of the author and the reader, misfortunes
too lowly, dramas too foul-mouthed, catastrophes
too commonplace in the terror they inspire. We were
curious to know if that conventional symbol of a forgotten
literature, of a vanished society, Tragedy, is
definitely dead; if, in a country where castes no longer
exist and aristocracy has no legal status, the miseries of
the lowly and the poor would appeal to public interest,
emotion, compassion, as forcibly as the miseries of the
great and the rich; if, in a word, the tears that are shed
in low life have the same power to cause tears to flow as
the tears shed in high life.</p>

<p>These thoughts led us to venture upon the humble
tale, <i>S&oelig;ur Philomène</i>, in 1861; they lead us to put forth
<i>Germinie Lacerteux</i> to-day.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<p>Now, let the book be spoken slightingly of; it matters
little. At this day, when the sphere of the Novel is
broadening and expanding, when it is beginning to be
the serious, impassioned, living form of literary study
and social investigation, when it is becoming, by virtue
of analysis and psychological research, the true History
of contemporary morals, when the novel has taken its
place among the necessary elements of knowledge, it
may properly demand its liberty and freedom of speech.
And to encourage it in the search for Art and Truth, to
authorize it to disclose misery and suffering which it is
not well for the fortunate people of Paris to forget, and
to show to people of fashion what the Sisters of Charity
have the courage to see for themselves, what the queens
of old compelled their children to touch with their eyes
in the hospitals: the visible, palpitating human suffering
that teaches charity; to confirm the novel in the practice
of that religion which the last century called by the
vast and far-reaching name, <i>Humanity</i>:&mdash;it needs no
other warrant than the consciousness that that is its
right.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<h2 class="chapter">SECOND PREFACE</h2>

<h3 class="chapter2">PREPARED FOR A POSTHUMOUS EDITION OF GERMINIE LACERTEUX</h3>


<p><i>July 22, 1862.</i>&mdash;The disease is gradually doing its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
work of destruction in our poor Rose. It is as if the
immaterial manifestations of life that formerly emanated
from her body were dying one by one. Her face is
entirely changed. Her expression is not the same,
her gestures are not the same; and she seems to me
as if she were putting off every day more and more
of that something, humanly speaking indefinable, which
makes the personality of a living being. Disease, before
making an end of its victim, introduces into
his body something strange, unfamiliar, something that
is <i>not he</i>, makes of him a new being, so to speak,
in whom we must seek to find the former being&mdash;he,
whose joyous, affectionate features have already ceased
to exist.</p>

<p><i>July 31.</i>&mdash;Doctor Simon is to tell me very soon
whether our dear old Rose will live or die. I am waiting
to hear his ring, which to me, is equivalent to that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
of a jury at the assizes, announcing their return to the
court room with their verdict. "It is all over, there is
no hope, it is simply a question of time. The disease
has progressed very rapidly. One lung is entirely gone
and the other substantially." And we must return to
the invalid, restore her serenity with a smile, give her
reason to hope for convalescence in every line of our
faces. Then we feel an unconquerable longing to rush
from the room and from the poor creature. We leave
the house, we wander at random through the streets;
at last, overdone with fatigue, we sit down at a table in
a café. We mechanically take up a copy of <i>L'Illustration</i>
and our eyes fall at once upon the solution of its
last riddle: <i>Against death, there is no appeal!</i></p>

<p><i>Monday, August 11.</i>&mdash;The disease of the lungs is
complicated with peritonitis. She has terrible pains in
the bowels, she cannot move without assistance, she cannot
lie on her back or her left side. In God's name, is
not death enough? must she also endure suffering, aye,
torture, as the final implacable breaking-up of the
human organism? And she suffers thus, poor wretch! in
one of the servant's rooms, where the sun, shining in
through a window in the sloping roof, makes the air
as stifling as in a hothouse, and where there is so little
room that the doctor has to put his hat on the bed.
We struggled to the last to keep her, but finally we had
to make up our minds to let her go away. She was
unwilling to go to Maison Dubois, where we proposed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
take her; it seems that twenty-five years ago, when she
first came to us, she went there to see the nurse in charge
of Edmond, who died there, and so that particular hospital
represents to her the place where people die. I
am waiting for Simon who is to bring her a permit to
go to Lariboisière. She passed almost a good night.
She is all ready, in high spirits, in fact. We have covered
everything up from her as well as we could. She
longs to be gone. She is in a great hurry. She feels
that she is going to get well there. At two o'clock
Simon arrives: "Here it is, all right." She refuses to
have a litter: "I should think I was dead!" she says.
She is dressed. As soon as she leaves her bed, all the
signs of life to be seen upon her face disappear. It is
as if the earth had risen under her skin. She comes
down into our apartments. Sitting in the dining-room,
with a trembling hand, the knuckles of which knock
against one another, she draws her stockings on over
a pair of legs like broomsticks, consumptive legs.
Then, for a long moment, she looks about at the
familiar objects with dying eyes that seem desirous to
take away with them the memory of the places they are
leaving&mdash;and the door of the apartment closes upon her
with a noise as of farewell. She reaches the foot of the
stairs, where she rests for an instant on a chair. The
concierge, in a bantering tone, assures her that she will
be well in six weeks. She bows and says "yes," an
inaudible "yes." The cab drives up to the door. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
rests her hand on the concierge's wife. I hold her
against the pillow she has behind her back. With wide
open, vacant eyes she vaguely watches the houses pass,
but she does not speak. At the door of the hospital
she tries to alight without assistance. "Can you walk
so far?" the concierge asks. She makes an affirmative
gesture and walks on. Really I cannot imagine where
she procured the strength to walk as she does. Here
we are at last in the great hall, a high, cold, bare,
clean place with a litter standing, all ready for use, in
the centre. I seat her in a straw armchair by a door
with a glazed wicket. A young man opens the wicket,
asks my name and age and writes busily for quarter of
an hour, covering ten or more sheets of paper with
a religious figure at the head. At last, everything is
ready, and I embrace her. A boy takes one arm, the
housekeeper the other.&mdash;After that, I saw nothing
more.</p>

<p><i>Thursday, August 14.</i>&mdash;We have been to Lariboisière.
We found Rose quiet, hopeful, talking of her approaching
discharge&mdash;in three weeks at most,&mdash;and so free
from all thought of death that she told us of a furious
love scene that took place yesterday between a woman
in the bed next hers and a brother of the Christian
schools, who was there again to-day. Poor Rose is
death, but death engrossed with life. Near her bed was
a young woman, whose husband, a mechanic, had come
to see her. "You see, as soon as I can walk, I shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
walk about the garden so much that they'll have to send
me home!" she said. And the mother in her added:
"Does the child ask for me sometimes?"</p>

<p>"Sometimes, oh! yes," the man replied.</p>

<p><i>Saturday, August 16.</i>&mdash;This morning, at ten o'clock,
someone rings the bell. I hear a colloquy at the door
between the housekeeper and the concierge. The door
opens, the concierge enters with a letter. I take the
letter; it bears the stamp of Lariboisière. Rose died
this morning at seven o'clock.</p>

<p>Poor girl! So it is all over! I knew that she was
doomed; but she was so animated, so cheerful, almost
happy, when we saw her Thursday! And here we are
both walking up and down the salon, filled with the
thought that a fellow-creature's death inspires: We shall
never see her again!&mdash;an instinctive thought that recurs
incessantly within you. What a void! what a gap in
our household! A habit, an attachment of twenty-five
years growth, a girl who knew our whole lives and
opened our letters in our absence, and to whom we told
all our business. When I was a bit of a boy I trundled
my hoop with her, and she bought me apple-tarts with
her own money, when we went to walk. She would sit
up for Edmond till morning, to open the door for him,
when he went to the Bal de l'Opéra without our mother's
knowledge. She was the woman, the excellent nurse,
whose hands mother placed in ours when she was dying.
She had the keys to everything, she managed everything,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
she did everything for our comfort. For twenty-five years
she tucked us up in bed every night, and every night
there were the same never-ending jokes about her ugliness
and her disgraceful physique. Sorrows and joys
alike she shared with us. She was one of those devoted
creatures upon whose solicitude you rely to close your
eyes. Our bodies, when we were ill or indisposed, were
accustomed to her attentions. She was familiar with all
our hobbies. She had known all our mistresses. She
was a piece of our life, part of the furniture of our
apartment, a stray memory of our youth, at once loving
and scolding and care-taking, like a watchdog whom we
were accustomed to having always beside us and about
us, and who ought to last as long as ourselves. And we
shall never see her again! It is not she moving about
the rooms; she will never again come to our rooms to
bid us good-morning! It is a great wrench, a great
change in our lives, which seems to us, I cannot say
why, like one of those solemn breaks in one's existence,
when, as Byron says, destiny changes horses.</p>

<p><i>Sunday, August 17.</i>&mdash;This morning we are to perform
all the last sad duties. We must return to the hospital,
enter once more the reception hall, where I seem to see
again, in the armchair against the wicket, the ghost of
the emaciated creature I seated there less than a week
ago. "Will you identify the body?" the attendant
hurls the question at me in a harsh voice. We go to the
further end of the hospital, to a high yellow door, upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
which is written in great black letters: <i>Amphitheatre</i>.
The attendant knocks. After some moments the door is
partly opened, and a head like a butcher's boy's appears,
with a short pipe in its mouth: a head which suggests
the gladiator and the grave-digger. I fancied that I was
at the circus, and that he was the slave who received the
gladiators' bodies; and he does receive the slain in that
great circus, society. They made us wait a long while
before opening another door, and during those moments
of suspense, all our courage oozed away, as the blood of a
wounded man who is forced to remain standing oozes
away, drop by drop. The mystery of what we were
about to see, the horror of a sight that rends your heart,
the search for the one body amid other bodies, the
scrutiny and recognition of that poor face, disfigured
doubtless&mdash;the thought of all this made us as timid as
children. We were at the end of our strength, at the
end of our will-power, at the end of our nervous
tension, and, when the door opened, we said: "We
will send some one," and fled. From there we went
to the mayor's office, riding in a cab that jolted us
and shook our heads about like empty things. And an
indefinable horror seized upon us of death in a hospital,
which seems to be only an administrative formality.
One would say that in that abode of agony, everything
is so well administered, regulated, reduced to system,
that death opens it as if it were an administrative
bureau.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>While we were having the death registered,&mdash;<i>Mon
Dieu!</i> the paper, all covered with writing and flourishes
for a poor woman's death!&mdash;a man rushed out of an
adjoining room, in joyous exultation, and looked at the
almanac hanging on the wall to find the name of the
saint of the day and give it to his child. As he passed,
the skirt of the happy father's coat swept the sheet on
which the death was registered from the desk to the floor.</p>

<p>When we returned home, we must look through her
papers, get her clothes together, sort out the clutter of
phials, bandages and innumerable things that sickness
collects&mdash;jostle death about, in short. It was a ghastly
thing to enter that attic, where the crumbs of bread
from her last meal were still lying in the folds of the
bedclothes. I threw the coverlid up over the bolster,
like a sheet over the ghost of a dead man.</p>

<p><i>Monday, August 18.</i>&mdash;The chapel is beside the amphitheatre.
In the hospital God and the dead body are
neighbors. At the mass said for the poor woman beside
her coffin, two or three others were placed near by to
reap the benefit of the service. There was an unpleasant
promiscuousness of salvation in that performance:
it resembled the common grave in the prayer.
Behind me, in the chapel, Rose's niece was weeping&mdash;the
little girl she had at our house for a short time, who
is now a young woman of nineteen, a pupil at the convent
of the Sisters of Saint-Laurent: a poor, weazened,
pale, stunted creature, rickety from starvation, with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
head too heavy for her body, back bent double, and the
air of a Mayeux&mdash;the last sad remnant of that consumption-ridden
family, awaited by Death and with his hand
even now heavy upon her,&mdash;in her soft eyes there is
already a gleam of the life beyond.</p>

<p>Then from the chapel to the extreme end of the
Montmartre cemetery,&mdash;vast as a necropolis and occupying
a whole quarter of the city,&mdash;walking at slow steps
through mud that never ends. Lastly the intoning of
the priests, and the coffin laboriously lowered by the
gravediggers' arms to the ends of the ropes, as a cask of
wine is lowered into a cellar.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday, August 20.</i>&mdash;Once more I must return to
the hospital. For since the visit I paid Rose on Thursday
and her sudden death the next day, there has existed for
me a mystery which I force from my thoughts, but which
constantly returns; the mystery of that agony of which I
know nothing, of that sudden end. I long to know and
I dread to learn. It does not seem to me as if she were
dead; I think of her simply as of a person who has disappeared.
My imagination returns to her last hours, gropes
for them in the darkness and reconstructs them, and they
torture me with their veiled horrors! I need to have my
doubts resolved. At last, this morning, I took my courage
in both hands. Again I see the hospital, again I see
the red-faced, obese concierge, reeking with life as one
reeks with wine, and the corridors where the morning
light falls upon the pale faces of smiling convalescents.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>In a distant corner, I rang at a door with little white
curtains. It was opened and I found myself in a parlor
where a Virgin stood upon a sort of altar between two
windows. On the northern wall of the room, the cold,
bare room, there are&mdash;why, I cannot explain&mdash;two
framed views of Vesuvius, wretched water-colors which
seem to shiver and to be entirely expatriated there.
Through an open door behind me, from a small room in
which the sun shines brightly, I hear the chattering of
sisters and children, childish joys, pretty little bursts of
laughter, all sorts of fresh, clear vocal notes: a sound as
from a dovecote bathed in the sun. Sisters in white with
black caps pass and repass; one stops in front of my
chair. She is short, badly developed, with an ugly,
sweet face, a poor face by the grace of God. She is
the mother of the Salle Saint-Joseph. She tells me how
Rose died, in hardly any pain, feeling that she was
improving, almost well, overflowing with encouragement
and hope. In the morning, after her bed was made,
without any suspicion that death was near, suddenly she
was taken with a hemorrhage, which lasted some few
seconds. I came away, much comforted, delivered
from the thought that she had had the anticipatory taste
of death, the horror of its approach.</p>

<p><i>Thursday, October 21.</i></p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p>In the midst of our dinner, which was rendered
melancholy enough by the constant hovering of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
conversation around the subject of death, Maria, who
came to dinner to-night, cried out, after two or three
nervous blows with her fingers upon her fluffy blonde
locks:&mdash;"My friends, while the poor girl was alive, I
kept the professional secret of my trade. But, now that
she is under ground, you must know the truth."</p>

<p>And thereupon we learned things concerning the
unhappy creature that took away our appetites, leaving
in our mouths the bitter taste of fruit cut with a steel
knife. And a whole strange, hateful, repugnant, deplorable
existence was revealed to us. The notes she signed,
the debts she has left behind her at all the dealers, have
the most unforeseen, the most amazing, the most incredible
basis. She kept men: the milkwoman's son, for
whom she furnished a chamber; another to whom she
carried our wine, chickens, food of all sorts. A secret
life of nocturnal orgies, of nights passed abroad, of
fierce nymphomania, that made her lovers say: "Either
she or I will stay on the field!" A passion, passions
with her whole head and heart and all her senses at
once, and complicated by all the wretched creatures'
diseases, consumption which adds frenzy to pleasure,
hysteria, the beginning of insanity. She had two children
by the milkwoman's son, one of whom lived six
months. Some years ago, when she told us that she was
going on a visit to her province, it was to lie in. And,
with regard to these men, her passion was so extravagant,
so unhealthy, so insane, that she, who was formerly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
honesty personified, actually stole from us, took twenty
franc pieces out of rolls of a hundred francs, so that the
lovers she paid might not leave her. Now, after these
involuntarily dishonest acts, these petty crimes extorted
from her upright nature, she plunged into such depths of
self-reproach, remorse, melancholy, such black despair,
that in that hell in which she rolled on from sin to sin,
desperate and unsatisfied, she had taken to drinking to
escape herself, to save herself from the present, to
drown herself and founder for a few moments in the
heavy slumber, the lethargic torpor in which she would
lie wallowing across her bed for a whole day, just as she
fell when she tried to make it. The miserable creature!
how great an incentive, how many motives and reasons
she found for devouring her suffering, and bleeding
internally: in the first place the rejection at intervals of
religious ideas by the terrors of a hell of fire and brimstone;
then jealousy, that characteristic jealousy of
everything and everybody that poisoned her life; then,
then&mdash;then the disgust which these men, after a time,
brutally expressed for her ugliness, and which drove her
deeper and deeper into sottishness,&mdash;caused her one day
to have a miscarriage, and she fell half dead on the
floor. Such a frightful tearing away of the veil we have
worn over our eyes is like the examination of a pocketful
of horrible things in a dead body suddenly opened. From
what we have heard I suddenly seem to realize what she
must have suffered for ten years past: the dread of an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
anonymous letter to us or of a denunciation from some
dealer; and the constant trepidation on the subject of
the money that was demanded of her, and that she could
not pay; and the shame felt by that proud creature,
perverted by the vile Quartier Saint-Georges, because of
her intimacy with low wretches whom she despised; and
the lamentable consciousness of the premature senility
caused by drunkenness; and the inhuman exactions
and brutality of the Alphonses of the gutter; and the
temptations to suicide which caused me to pull her away
from a window one day, when I found her leaning far
out&mdash;and lastly all the tears that we believed to be
without cause&mdash;all these things mingled with a very
deep and heartfelt affection for us, and with a vehement,
feverish devotion when either of us was ill. And this
woman possessed an energetic character, a force of will,
a skill in mystification, to which nothing can be compared.
Yes, yes, all those frightful secrets kept under
lock and key, hidden, buried deep in her own heart, so
that neither our eyes, nor our ears, nor our powers of
observation ever detected aught amiss, even in her
hysterical attacks, when nothing escaped her but groans:
a mystery preserved until her death, and which she must
have believed would be buried with her. And of what
did she die? She died, because, all through one rainy
winter's night, eight months ago, at Montmartre, she
spied upon the milkwoman's son, who had turned her
away, in order to find out with what woman he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
filled her place; a whole night leaning against a ground-floor
window, as a result of which she was drenched to
the bones with deadly pleurisy!</p>

<p>Poor creature, we forgive her; indeed, a vast compassion
for her fills our hearts, as we reflect upon all
that she has suffered. But we have become suspicious,
for our lives, of the whole female sex, and of women
above us as well as of women below us in station. We
are terror-stricken at the double lining of their hearts,
at the marvelous faculty, the science, the consummate
genius of falsehood with which their whole being is
instinct.</p>

<h2 class="chapter">I</h2>


<p>"Saved! so you are really out of danger, mademoiselle!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
exclaimed the maid with a cry of joy, as she
closed the door upon the doctor, and, rushing to the bed
on which her mistress lay, she began, in a frenzy of happiness
and with a shower of kisses to embrace, together with
the bed covers, the old woman's poor, emaciated body,
which seemed, in the huge bed, as small as a child's.</p>

<p>The old woman took her head, silently, in both
hands, pressed it against her heart, heaved a sigh, and
muttered: "Ah, well! so I must live on!"</p>

<p>This took place in a small room, through the window
of which could be seen a small patch of sky cut by
three black iron pipes, various neighboring roofs, and in
the distance, between two houses that almost touched,
the leafless branch of a tree, whose trunk was invisible.</p>

<p>On the mantelpiece, in a mahogany box, was a square
clock with a large dial, huge figures and bulky hands.
Beside it, under glass covers, were two candlesticks
formed by three silver swans twisting their necks around
a golden quiver. Near the fireplace an easy chair <i>à la
Voltaire</i>, covered with one of the pieces of tapestry of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
checker-board pattern, which little girls and old women
make, extended its empty arms. Two little Italian
landscapes, a flower piece in water-colors after Bertin,
with a date in red ink at the bottom, and a few miniatures
hung on the walls.</p>

<p>Upon the mahogany commode of an Empire pattern,
a statue of Time in black bronze, running with his
scythe in rest, served as a watch stand for a small watch
with a monogram in diamonds upon blue enamel, surrounded
with pearls. The floor was covered with a
bright carpet with black and green stripes. The curtains
at the bed and the window were of old-fashioned
chintz with red figures upon a chocolate ground.</p>

<p>At the head of the bed, a portrait inclined over the
invalid and seemed to gaze sternly at her. It represented
a man with harsh features, whose face emerged
from the high collar of a green satin coat, and a muslin
cravat, with waving ends, tied loosely around the neck,
in the style of the early years of the Revolution. The
old woman in the bed resembled the portrait. She had
the same bushy, commanding black eyebrows, the same
aquiline nose, the same clearly marked lines of will,
resolution and energy. The portrait seemed to cast
a reflection upon her, as a father's face is reflected in
his child's. But in hers the harshness of the features
was softened by a gleam of rough kindliness, by an
indefinable flame of sturdy devotion and masculine
charity.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>The light in the room was the light of an evening in
early spring, about five o'clock, a light as clear as crystal
and as white as silver, the cold, chaste, soft light,
which fades away in the flush of the sunset passing into
twilight. The sky was filled with that light of a new
life, adorably melancholy, like the still naked earth, and
so replete with pathos that it moves happy souls to tears.</p>

<p>"Well, well! my silly Germinie, weeping?" said
the old woman, a moment later, withdrawing her hands
which were moist with her maid's kisses.</p>

<p>"Oh! my dear, kind mademoiselle, I would like to
weep like this all the time! it's so good! it brings my
poor mother back before my eyes&mdash;and everything!&mdash;if
you only knew!"</p>

<p>"Go on, go on," said her mistress, closing her eyes
to listen, "tell me about it."</p>

<p>"Oh! my poor mother!" The maid paused a moment.
Then, with the flood of words that gushes forth
with tears of joy, she continued, as if, in the emotion
and outpouring of her happiness, her whole childhood
flowed back into her heart! "Poor woman! I can
see her now the last time she went out to take me to
mass, one 21st of January, I remember. In those days
they read from the king's Testament. Ah! she suffered
enough on my account, did mamma! She was forty-two
years old, when I was born&mdash;&mdash;papa made her cry
a good deal! There were three of us before and there
wasn't any too much bread in the house. And then he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
was proud as anything. If we'd had only a handful of
peas in the house he would never have gone to the curé
for help. Ah! we didn't eat bacon every day at our
house. Never mind; for all that mamma loved me a
little more and she always found a little fat or cheese in
some corner to put on my bread. I wasn't five when
she died. That was a bad thing for us all. I had a
tall brother, who was white as a sheet, with a yellow
beard&mdash;and good! you have no idea. Everybody loved
him. They gave him all sorts of names. Some called
him Boda&mdash;why, I don't know. Others called him
Jesus Christ. Ah! he was a worker, he was! It didn't
make any difference to him that his health was good for
nothing; at daybreak he was always at his loom&mdash;for
we were weavers, you must know&mdash;and he never put his
shuttle down till night. And honest, too, if you knew!
People came from all about to bring him their yarn,
and without weighing it, too. He was a great friend of
the schoolmaster, and he used to write the <i>mottoes</i> for
the carnival. My father, he was a different sort: he'd
work for a moment, or an hour, you know, and then
he'd go off into the fields&mdash;and when he came home
he'd beat us, and beat us hard. He was like a madman;
they said it was because he was consumptive. It
was lucky my brother was there: he used to prevent my
second sister from pulling my hair and hurting me,
because she was jealous. He always took me by the
hand to go and see them play skittles. In fact, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
supported the family all alone. For my first communion
he had the bells rung! Ah! he did a heap of work so
that I should be like the others, in a little white dress
with flounces and a little bag in my hand, such as they
used to carry in those days. I didn't have any cap: I
remember making myself a pretty little wreath of ribbons
and the white pith you pull off when you strip
reeds; there was lots of it in the places where we used
to put the hemp to soak. That was one of my great
days&mdash;that and the drawing lots for the pigs at
Christmas&mdash;and the days when I went to help them tie
up the vines; that was in June, you know. We had a
little vineyard near Saint Hilaire. There was one very
hard year in those days&mdash;do you remember it, mademoiselle?&mdash;the
long frost of 1828 that ruined everything.
It extended as far as Dijon and farther, too&mdash;people had
to make bread from bran. My brother nearly killed
himself with work. Father, who was always out of
doors tramping about the fields, sometimes brought
home a few mushrooms. It was pretty bad, all the
same; we were hungry oftener than anything else.
When I was out in the fields myself, I'd look around to
see if anyone could see me, and then I'd crawl along
softly on my knees, and when I was under a cow, I'd
take off one of my sabots and begin to milk her.
Bless me! I came near being caught at it! My oldest
sister was out at service with the Mayor of Lenclos, and
she sent home her wages&mdash;twenty-four francs&mdash;it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
always as much as that. The second worked at dressmaking
in bourgeois families; but they didn't pay the
prices then that they do to-day; she worked from six
in the morning till dark for eight sous. Out of that she
wanted to put some by for a dress for the fête on Saint-Remi's
day.&mdash;Ah! that's the way it is with us: there
are many who live on two potatoes a day for six months
so as to have a new dress for that day. Bad luck fell
on us on all sides. My father died. We had to sell a
small field, and a bit of a vineyard that yielded a cask
of wine every year. The notaries don't work for
nothing. When my brother was sick there was nothing
to give him to drink but <i>lees</i> that we'd been putting
water to for a year. And there wasn't any change of
linen for him; all the sheets in the wardrobe, which
had a golden cross on top of it in mother's time, had
gone&mdash;and the cross too. More than that, before he
was sick this time, my brother goes off to the fête at
Clefmont. He hears someone say that my sister had
gone wrong with the mayor she worked for; he falls on
the men who said it, but he wasn't very strong. They
were, though, and they threw him down, and when he
was down, they kicked him with their wooden shoes,
in the pit of the stomach. He was brought home to us
for dead. The doctor put him on his feet again, though,
and told us he was cured. But he could just drag himself
along. I could see that he was going when he
kissed me. When he was dead, poor dear boy, Cadet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
Ballard had to use all his strength to take me away
from the body. The whole village, mayor and all, went
to his funeral. As my sister couldn't keep her place
with the mayor on account of the things he said to her,
and had gone to Paris to find a place, my other sister
went after her. I was left all alone. One of my
mother's cousins then took me with her to Damblin;
but I was all upset there; I cried all night long,
and whenever I could run away I always went back to
our house. Just to see the old vine at our door, from
the end of the street, did me good! it put strength into
my legs. The good people who had bought the house
would keep me till someone came for me! they were
always sure to find me there. At last they wrote to my
sister in Paris that, if she didn't send for me to come
and live with her, I wasn't likely to live long. It's a
fact that I was just like wax. They put me in charge of
the driver of a small wagon that went from Langres to
Paris every month, and that's how I came to Paris. I
was fourteen years old, then. I remember that I went
to bed all dressed all the way, because they made me
sleep in the common room. When I arrived I was
covered with lice."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<h2 class="chapter">II</h2>


<p>The old woman said nothing: she was comparing her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
own life with her servant's.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p>Mademoiselle de Varandeuil was born in 1782. She
first saw the light in a mansion on Rue Royale and
Mesdames de France were her sponsors in baptism.
Her father was a close friend of the Comte d'Artois,
in whose household he held an important post. He
joined in all his hunting-parties, and was one of the
few familiar spirits, in whose presence, at the mass
preceding the hunt, he who was one day to be King
Charles X. used to hurry the officiating priest by saying
in an undertone: "Psit! psit! curé, swallow your
<i>Good Lord</i> quickly!"</p>

<p>Monsieur de Varandeuil had made one of those
marriages which were customary enough in his day: he
had espoused a sort of actress, a singer, who, although
she had no great talent, had made a success at the
<i>Concert Spirituel</i>, beside Madame Todi, Madame Ponteuil
and Madame Saint-Huberty. The little girl born
of this marriage in 1782 was sickly and delicate, ugly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
of feature, with a nose even then large enough to be
absurd, her father's nose in a face as thin as a man's
wrist. She had nothing of what her parents' vanity
would have liked her to have. After making a fiasco on
the piano at the age of five, at a concert given by her
mother in her salon, she was relegated to the society of
the servants. Except for a moment in the morning, she
never went near her mother, who always made her kiss
her under the chin, so that she might not disturb her
rouge. When the Revolution arrived, Monsieur de
Varandeuil, thanks to the Comte d'Artois' patronage,
was disburser of pensions. Madame de Varandeuil was
traveling in Italy, whither she had ordered her physician
to send her on the pretext of ill health, leaving her
daughter and an infant son in her husband's charge.
The absorbing anxiety of the times, the tempests threatening
wealth and the families that handled wealth&mdash;Monsieur
de Varandeuil's brother was a Farmer-General&mdash;left
that very selfish and unloving father but little
leisure to attend to the wants of his children. Thereupon,
he began to be somewhat embarrassed pecuniarily.
He left Rue Royale and took up his abode at the Hôtel
du Petit-Charolais, belonging to his mother, who allowed
him to install himself there. Events moved rapidly;
one evening, in the early days of the guillotine, as he
was walking along Rue Saint-Antoine, he heard a hawker
in front of him, crying the journal: <i>Aux Voleurs! Aux
Voleurs!</i> According to the usual custom of those days,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
he gave a list of the articles contained in the number he
had for sale: Monsieur de Varandeuil heard his own
name mingled with oaths and obscenity. He bought
the paper and read therein a revolutionary denunciation
of himself.</p>

<p>Some time after, his brother was arrested and detained
at Hôtel Talaru with the other Farmers-General. His
mother, in a paroxysm of terror, had foolishly sold the
Hôtel du Petit-Charolais, where he was living, for the
value of the mirrors: she was paid in <i>assignats</i>, and
died of despair over the constant depreciation of the
paper. Luckily Monsieur de Varandeuil obtained from
the purchasers, who could find no tenants, leave to occupy
the rooms formerly used by the stableboys. He took
refuge there, among the outbuildings of the mansion,
stripped himself of his name and posted at the door,
as he was ordered to do, his family name of Roulot,
under which he buried the <i>De Varandeuil</i> and the
former courtier of the Comte d'Artois. He lived there
alone, buried, forgotten, hiding his head, never going
out, cowering in his hole, without servants, waited upon
by his daughter, to whom he left everything. The Terror
was to them a period of shuddering suspense, the breathless
excitement of impending death. Every evening,
the little girl went and listened at a grated window to
the day's crop of condemnations, the <i>List of Prize
Winners in the Lottery of Saint Guillotine</i>. She
answered every knock at the door, thinking that they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
had come to take her father to the Place de la Révolution,
whither her uncle had already been taken. The
moment came when money, the money that was so
scarce, no longer procured bread. It was necessary to
go and get it, almost by force, at the doors of the
bakeries; it was necessary to earn it by standing for
hours in the cold, biting night air, in the crushing
pressure of crowds of people; to stand in line from three
o'clock in the morning. The father did not care to
venture into that mass of humanity. He was afraid of
being recognized, of compromising himself by one of
those outbursts to which his impetuous nature would
have given vent, no matter where he might be. Then,
too, he recoiled from the fatigue and severity of the
task. The little boy was still too small; he would have
been crushed; so the duty of obtaining bread for three
mouths each day fell to the daughter. She obtained it.
With her little thin body, fairly lost in her father's
knitted jacket, a cotton cap pulled down over her eyes,
her limbs all huddled together to retain a little warmth,
she would wait, shivering, her eyes aching with cold,
amid the pushing and buffeting, until the baker's wife
on Rue des Francs-Bourgeois placed in her hands a loaf
which her little fingers, stiff with cold, could hardly
hold. At last, this poor little creature, who returned
day after day, with her pinched face and her emaciated,
trembling body, moved the baker's wife to pity. With
the kindness of heart of a woman of the people, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
would send the coveted loaf to the little one by her
boy as soon as she appeared in the long line. But one
day, just as she put out her hand to take it, a woman,
whose jealousy was aroused by this mark of favor and
preference, dealt the child a kick with her wooden shoe
which kept her in bed almost a month. Mademoiselle
de Varandeuil bore the marks of the blow all her life.</p>

<p>During that month, the whole family would have died
of starvation, had it not been for a supply of rice, which
one of their acquaintances, the Comtesse d'Auteuil, had
had the forethought to lay aside, and which she consented
to share with the father and the two children.</p>

<p>Thus, Monsieur de Varandeuil escaped the Revolutionary
Tribunal by burying himself in obscurity. He
escaped it also by reason of the fact that the accounts of
his administration of his office were still unsettled, as he
had had the good fortune to procure the postponement of
the settlement from month to month. Then, too, he kept
suspicion at bay by his personal animosity toward some
great personages at court, and by the hatred of the
queen which many retainers of the king's brothers had
conceived. Whenever he had occasion to speak of
that wretched woman, he used violent, bitter, insulting
words, uttered in such a passionate, sincere tone that
they almost made him appear as an enemy of the
royal family; so that those to whom he was simply
Citizen Roulot looked upon him as a good patriot, and
those who knew his former name almost excused him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
for having been what he had been: a noble, the friend
of a prince of the blood, and a place holder.</p>

<p>The Republic had reached the epoch of patriotic
suppers, those repasts of a whole street in the street;
Mademoiselle de Varandeuil, in her confused, terrified
reminiscences of those days, could still see the tables
on Rue Pavée, with their legs in the streams of the
blood of September flowing from La Force! It was at
one of these suppers that Monsieur de Varandeuil conceived
a scheme that completely assured his immunity.
He informed two of his neighbors at table, devoted
patriots both, one of whom was on intimate terms with
Chaumette, that he was in great embarrassment because
his daughter had been privately baptized only, so that she
had no civil status, and said that he would be very happy
if Chaumette would have her entered on the registers of
the municipality and honor her with a name selected by
him from the Republican calendar of Greece or Rome.
Chaumette at once arranged a meeting with this father,
<i>who had reached so high a level</i>, as they said in those days.
During the interview Mademoiselle de Varandeuil was
taken into a closet where she found two women who were
instructed to satisfy themselves as to her sex, and she
showed them her breast. They then escorted her to the
great Salle des Declarations, and there, after a metaphorical
allocution, Chaumette baptized her <i>Sempronie</i>;
a name which habit was destined to fasten upon Mademoiselle
de Varandeuil and which she never abandoned.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>Somewhat protected and reassured by that episode,
the family passed through the terrible days preceding
the fall of Robespierre. At last came the ninth Thermidor
and deliverance. But poverty was none the less
a pressing fact in the Varandeuil household. They had
not lived through the bitter days of the Revolution,
they were not to live through the wretched days of
the Directory without unhoped-for succor, money sent
by Providence by the hand of Folly. The father
and the two children could hardly have existed without
the income from four shares in the <i>Vaudeville</i>, an
investment which Monsieur de Varandeuil was happily
inspired to make in 1791, and which proved to be the
best of all possible investments in those years of death,
when people felt the need of forgetting death every
evening&mdash;in those days of supreme agony, when everyone
wished to laugh his last laugh at the latest song.
Soon these shares, added to the amount of some outstanding
claims that were paid, provided the family
with something more than bread. They thereupon left
the eaves of the Hôtel du Petit-Charolais and took a
small suite in the Marais, on Rue du Chaume.</p>

<p>No change took place, however, in the habits of the
household. The daughter continued to wait upon her
father and brother. Monsieur de Varandeuil had gradually
become accustomed to see in her only the woman
indicated by her costume and by the work that she did.
The father's eyes did not care to recognize a daughter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
in that servant's garb and in her performance of menial
occupations. She was no longer a person with his blood
in her veins or who had the honor to belong to him:
she was a servant; and his selfishness confirmed him so
fully in that idea and in his harsh treatment of her, he
found that filial, affectionate, respectful service,&mdash;which
cost nothing at all, by the way,&mdash;so convenient, that it
cost him a bitter pang to give it up later, when a little
more money mended the family fortunes: battles had
to be fought to induce him to take a maid to fill his
child's place and to relieve the girl from the most
humiliating domestic labor.</p>

<p>They were without information concerning Madame
de Varandeuil, who had refused to join her husband at
Paris during the early years of the Revolution; at last
they learned that she had married again in Germany,
producing, as a certificate of her husband's death, the
death certificate of his guillotined brother, the baptismal
name having been changed. The girl grew up, therefore,
abandoned, without affection, with no mother
except a woman dead to her family, whom her father
taught her to despise. Her childhood was passed in
constant anxiety, in the privations that wear life away,
in the fatigue resulting from labor that exhausted the
strength of a sickly child, in an expectation of death
that became, at last, an impatient longing to die: there
had been hours when that girl of thirteen was tempted
to do as many women did in those days&mdash;to open the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
door and rush into the street, crying: <i>Vive le roi!</i> in
order to end it all. Her girlhood was a continuation
of her childhood with less tragic motives of weariness.
She had to submit to the ill humor, the exactions, the
bitter moods, the tempestuous outbreaks of her father,
which had been hitherto somewhat curbed and restrained
by the great tempest of the time. She was still doomed
to undergo the fatigues and humiliations of a servant.
She remained alone with her father, kept down and
humbled, shut out from his arms and his kisses, her
heart heavy with grief because she longed to love and
had nothing to love. She was beginning to suffer from
the cold void that is formed about a woman by an unattractive,
unfascinating girlhood, by a girlhood devoid of
beauty and sympathetic charm. She could see that she
aroused a sort of compassion with her long nose, her
yellow complexion, her angular figure, her thin body.
She felt that she was ugly, and that her ugliness was
made repulsive by her miserable costumes, her dismal,
woolen dresses which she made herself, her father paying
for the material only after much grumbling: she
could not induce him to make her a small allowance for
her toilet until she was thirty-five.</p>

<p>How sad and bitter and lonely for her was her life
with that morose, sour old man, who was always scolding
and complaining at home, affable only in society,
and who left her every evening to go to the great houses
that were reopened under the Directory and at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
beginning of the Empire! Only at very long intervals
did he take her out, and when he did, it was always to
that everlasting <i>Vaudeville</i>, where he had boxes. Even
on those rare occasions, his daughter was terrified. She
trembled all the time that she was with him; she was
afraid of his violent disposition, of the tone of the old
régime that his outbreaks of wrath had retained, of the
facility with which he would raise his cane at an insolent
remark from the <i>canaille</i>. On almost every occasion
there were scenes with the manager, wordy disputes with
people in the pit, and threats of personal violence to
which she put an end by lowering the curtain of the
box. The same thing was kept up in the street, even
in the cab, with the driver, who would refuse to carry
them at Monsieur de Varandeuil's price and would keep
them waiting one hour, two hours without moving;
sometimes would unharness his horse in his wrath and
leave him in the vehicle with his daughter who would
vainly implore him to submit and pay the price demanded.</p>

<p>Considering that these diversions should suffice for
Sempronie, and having, moreover, a jealous desire to
have her all to himself and always under his hand,
Monsieur de Varandeuil allowed her to form no intimacies
with anybody. He did not take her into society;
he did not take her to the houses of their kinsfolk who
returned after the emigration, except on days of formal
receptions or family gatherings. He kept her closely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
confined to the house: not until she was forty did he
consider that she was old enough to be allowed to go
out alone. Thus, the girl had no friendship, no connection
of any sort to lean upon; indeed, she no longer
had her younger brother with her, as he had gone to
the United States and enlisted in the American navy.</p>

<p>She was forbidden by her father to marry, he did not
admit that she would allow herself even to think of
marrying and deserting him; all the suitors who might
have come forward he fought and rejected in advance,
in order not to leave his daughter the courage to speak
to him on the subject, if the occasion should ever arise.</p>

<p>Meanwhile our victories were stripping Italy of her
treasures. The masterpieces of Rome, Florence and
Venice were hurrying to Paris. Italian art was at a
premium. Collectors no longer took pride in any paintings
but those of the Italian school. Monsieur de Varandeuil
saw an opening for a fortune in this change of
taste. He, also, had fallen a victim to the artistic dilettantism
which was one of the refined passions of the
nobility before the Revolution. He had lived in the
society of artists and collectors; he admired pictures.
It occurred to him to collect a gallery of Italian works
and then to sell them. Paris was still overrun with the
objects of art sold and scattered under the Terror.
Monsieur de Varandeuil began to walk back and forth
through the streets&mdash;they were the markets for large
canvases in those days,&mdash;and at every step he made a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
discovery; every day he purchased something. Soon
the small apartment was crowded with old, black paintings,
so large for the most part that the walls would not
hold them with their frames, with the result that there
was no room for the furniture. These were christened
Raphael, Vinci, or Andrea del Sarto; there were none
but <i>chefs d'&oelig;uvre</i>, and the father would keep his daughter
standing in front of them hours at a time, forcing
his admiration upon her, wearying her with his ecstatic
flights. He would ascend from epithet to epithet, would
work himself into a state of intoxication, of delirium,
and would end by thinking that he was negotiating
with an imaginary purchaser, would dispute with him
over the price of a masterpiece, and would cry out:
"A hundred thousand francs for my Rosso! yes, monsieur,
a hundred thousand francs!" His daughter, dismayed
by the large amount of money that those great,
ugly things, in which there were so many nude men,
deducted from the housekeeping supply, ventured upon
remonstrance and tried to check such ruinous extravagance.
Monsieur de Varandeuil lost his temper, waxed
wroth like a man who was ashamed to find one of his
blood so deficient in taste, and told her that that was
her fortune and that she would see later if he was an old
fool. At last she induced him to realize. The sale
took place; it was a failure, one of the most complete
shipwrecks of illusions that the glazed hall of the Hôtel
Bullion has ever seen. Stung to the quick, furious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
with rage at this blow, which not only involved pecuniary
loss and a serious inroad upon his little fortune,
but was also a direct denial of his claims to connoisseurship,
a slap at his knowledge of art delivered upon the
cheek of his Raphaels, Monsieur de Varandeuil informed
his daughter that they were too poor to remain in Paris
and that they must go into the provinces to live. Having
been cradled and reared in an epoch little adapted
to inspire a love of country life in women, Mademoiselle
de Varandeuil tried vainly to combat her father's resolution:
she was obliged to go with him wherever he
chose to go, and, by leaving Paris, to lose the society
and friendship of two young kinswomen, to whom, in
their too infrequent interviews, she had partly given her
confidence, and whose hearts she had felt reaching out to
her as to an older sister.</p>

<p>Monsieur de Varandeuil hired a small house at L'Isle-Adam.
There he was near familiar scenes, in the
atmosphere of what was formerly a little court, close at
hand to two or three châteaux, whose owners he knew,
and which were beginning to throw open their doors
once more. Then, too, since the Revolution a little
community of well-to-do bourgeois, rich shopkeepers,
had settled upon this territory which once belonged to
the Contis. The name of Monsieur de Varandeuil
sounded very grand in the ears of all those good people.
They bowed very low to him, they contended for the
honor of entertaining him, they listened respectfully,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
almost devoutly, to the stories he told of society as it
was. And thus, flattered, caressed, honored as a relic
of Versailles, he had the place of honor and the prestige
of a lord among them. When he dined with
Madame Mutel, a former baker, who had forty thousand
francs a year, the hostess left the table, silk dress and
all, to go and fry the oyster plants herself: Monsieur
de Varandeuil did not like them except as she cooked
them. But Monsieur de Varandeuil's decision to go
into retirement at L'Isle-Adam was mainly due, not to
the pleasant surroundings there, but to a project that he
had formed. He had gone thither to obtain leisure for a
monumental work. That which he had been unable to
do for the honor and glory of Italian art by his collection,
he proposed to do by his pen. He had learned a
little Italian with his wife; he took it into his head to
present Vasari's <i>Lives of the Painters</i> to the French
public, to translate it with the assistance of his daughter,
who, when she was very small, had heard her mother's
maid speak Italian and had retained a few words. He
plunged the girl into Vasari, he locked up her time and
her thoughts in grammars, dictionaries, commentaries,
all the works of all the scholiasts of Italian art, kept
her bending double over the ungrateful toil, the <i>ennui</i>
and labor of translating Italian words, groping in the
darkness of her imperfect knowledge. The whole burden
of the book fell upon her; when he had laid out
her task, he would leave her tête-à-tête with the volumes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
bound in white vellum, to go and ramble about the
neighborhood, paying visits, gambling at some château
or dining among the bourgeois of his acquaintance, to
whom he would complain pathetically of the laborious
effort that the vast undertaking of his translation entailed
upon him. He would return home, listen to the reading
of the translation made during the day, make comments
and critical remarks, and upset a sentence to give
it a different meaning, which his daughter would eliminate
again when he had gone; then he would resume
his walks and jaunts, like a man who has well earned his
leisure, walking very erect, with his hat under his arm
and dainty pumps on his feet, enjoying himself, the sky
and the trees and Rousseau's God, gentle to all nature
and loving to the plants. From time to time fits of
impatience, common to children and old men, would
overtake him; he would demand a certain number of
pages for the next day, and would compel his daughter
to sit up half the night.</p>

<p>Two or three years passed in this labor, in which
Sempronie's eyes were ruined at last. She lived entombed
in her father's Vasari, more entirely alone than
ever, holding aloof through innate, haughty repugnance
from the bourgeois ladies of L'Isle-Adam and
their manners <i>à la Madame Angot</i>, and too poorly clad
to visit at the châteaux. For her, there was no pleasure,
no diversion, which was not made wretched and poisoned
by her father's eccentricities and fretful humor. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
tore up the flowers that she planted secretly in the
garden. He would have nothing there but vegetables
and he cultivated them himself, putting forth grand
utilitarian theories, arguments which might have induced
the Convention to convert the Tuileries into a potato
field. Her only enjoyment was when her father, at
very long intervals, allowed her to entertain one of her
two young friends for a week&mdash;a week which would have
been seven days of paradise to Sempronie, had not her
father embittered its joys, its diversions, its fêtes, with
his always threatening outbreaks, his ill-humor always
armed and alert, and his constant fault-finding about
trifles&mdash;a bottle of eau de Cologne that Sempronie asked
for to place in her friend's room, a dish for her dinner,
or a place to which she wished to take her.</p>

<p>At L'Isle-Adam Monsieur de Varandeuil had hired a
servant, who almost immediately became his mistress.
A child was born of this connection, and the father, in
his cynical indifference, was shameless enough to have
it brought up under his daughter's eyes. As the years
rolled on the woman acquired a firm foothold in the
house. She ended by ruling the household, father and
daughter alike. The day came when Monsieur de
Varandeuil chose to have her sit at his table and be
served by Sempronie. That was too much. Mademoiselle
de Varandeuil rebelled under the insult, and
drew herself up to the full height of her indignation.
Secretly, silently, in misery and isolation, harshly treated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
by the people and the things about her, the girl had
built up a resolute, straightforward character; tears had
tempered instead of softening it. Beneath filial docility
and humility, beneath passive obedience, beneath apparent
gentleness of disposition, she concealed a character
of iron, a man's strength of will, one of those
hearts which nothing bends and which never bend themselves.
When her father demanded that she lower herself
to that extent, she reminded him that she was his
daughter, she reviewed her whole life, cast, in a flood of
words, the shame and the reproach of it in his face, and
concluded by informing him that if that woman did not
leave the house that very evening, she would leave it,
and that she should have no difficulty in living, thank
God! wherever she might go, with the simple tastes he
had forced upon her. The father, thunderstruck and
bewildered by this revolt, yielded and dismissed the
servant; but he retained a dastardly sort of rancor
against his daughter on account of the sacrifice she had
extorted from him. His spleen betrayed itself in sharp,
aggressive words, ironical thanks and bitter smiles.
Sempronie's only revenge was to attend to his wants
more thoroughly, more gently, more patiently than ever.
Her devotion was destined to be subjected to one final
test; the old man had a stroke of apoplexy which left
him with one whole side of his body stiff and dead,
lame in one leg, and asleep so far as his intelligence was
concerned, although keenly conscious of his misfortune<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
and of his dependence upon his daughter. Thereupon,
all the evil that lay dormant in the depths of his nature
was aroused and let loose. His selfishness amounted to
ferocity. Under the torment of his suffering and his
weakness, he became a sort of malevolent madman.
Mademoiselle de Varandeuil devoted her days and her
nights to the invalid, who seemed to hate her for her
attentions, to be humiliated by her care as if it implied
generosity and forgiveness, to suffer torments at seeing
always by his side, indefatigable and kindly, that image
of duty. But what a life it was! She had to contend
against the miserable man's incurable <i>ennui</i>, to be always
ready to bear him company, to lead him about and support
him all day long. She must play cards with him
when he was at home, and not let him win or lose too
much. She must combat his wishes, his gormandizing
tendencies, take dishes away from him, and, in connection
with everything that he wanted, endure complaints,
reproaches, insults, tears, mad despair, and the
outbursts of childish anger in which helpless old men
indulge. And this lasted ten years! ten years, during
which Mademoiselle de Varandeuil had no other recreation,
no other consolation than to pour out all the tenderness
and warmth of a maternal affection upon one of her
two young friends, recently married,&mdash;her <i>chick</i>, as she
called her. It was Mademoiselle de Varandeuil's delight
to go and pass a short time every fortnight in that
happy household. She would kiss the pretty child,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
already in its cradle and asleep for the night when she
arrived; she would dine at racing speed; at dessert she
would send for a carriage and would hasten away like a
tardy schoolboy. But in the last years of her father's
life she could not even obtain permission to dine out:
the old man would no longer sanction such a long
absence and kept her almost constantly beside him,
repeating again and again that he was well aware that
it was not amusing to take care of an infirm old man
like himself, but that she would soon be rid of him.
He died in 1818, and, before his death, could find no
words but these for her who had been his daughter
nearly forty years: "I know that you never loved
me!"</p>

<p>Two years before her father's death, Sempronie's
brother had returned from America. He brought with
him a colored woman who had nursed him through the
yellow fever, and two girls, already grown up, whom he
had had by the woman before marrying her. Although
she was imbued with the ideas of the old régime as to
the blacks, and although she looked upon that ignorant
creature, with her negro jargon, her grin like a wild
beast's and her skin that left grease stains upon her
clothing, as no better than a monkey, Mademoiselle de
Varandeuil combated her father's horror and unwillingness
to receive his daughter-in-law; and she it was who
induced him, in the last days of his life, to allow her
brother to present his wife to him. When her father was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
dead she reflected that her brother's household was all
that remained of the family.</p>

<p>Monsieur de Varandeuil, to whom the Comte d'Artois
had caused the arrears of salary of his office to be paid
at the return of the Bourbons, left about ten thousand
francs a year to his children. The brother had, before
that inheritance, only a pension of fifteen hundred francs
from the United States. Mademoiselle de Varandeuil
considered that five or six thousand francs a year would
hardly suffice for the comfortable support of that family,
in which there were two children, and it at once occurred
to her to add to it her share in the inheritance.
She suggested this contribution in the most natural and
simple way imaginable. Her brother accepted it, and
she went with him to live in a pretty little apartment at
the upper end of Rue de Clichy, on the fourth floor of
one of the first houses built in that neighborhood, then
hardly known, where the fresh country air blew briskly
through the framework of the white buildings. She
continued there her modest life, her humble manner of
dressing, her economical habits, content with the least
desirable room in the suite, and spending upon herself
no more than eighteen hundred to two thousand francs a
year. But, soon, a brooding jealousy, slowly gathering
strength, took possession of the mulattress. She took
offence at the fraternal affection which seemed to be
taking her husband from her arms. She suffered because
of the communion of speech and thought and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
reminiscences between them; she suffered because of
the conversations in which she could take no part,
because of what she heard in their voices, but could not
understand. The consciousness of her inferiority kindled
in her heart the fires of wrath and hatred that
burn fiercely in the tropics. She had recourse to her
children for her revenge; she urged them on, excited
them, aroused their evil passions against her sister-in-law.
She encouraged them to laugh at her, to make
sport of her. She applauded the manifestations of the
mischievous intelligence characteristic of children, in
whom observation begins with naughtiness. Once she
had let them loose upon their aunt, she allowed them
to laugh at all her absurdities, her figure, her nose, her
dresses, whose meanness, nevertheless, provided their
own elegant attire. Thus incited and upheld, the little
ones soon arrived at insolence. Mademoiselle de
Varandeuil had the quick temper that accompanies
kindness of heart. With her the hand, as well as the
heart, had a part in the first impulse. And then she
shared the prevalent opinion of her time as to the
proper way of bringing up children. She endured two
or three impertinent sallies without a word; but at the
fourth she seized the mocking child, took down her
skirts, and administered to her, notwithstanding her
twelve years, the soundest whipping she had ever received.
The mulattress made a great outcry and told her
sister-in-law, that she had always detested her children<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
and that she wanted to kill them. The brother interposed
between the two women and succeeded in reconciling
them after a fashion. But new scenes took place,
when the little ones, inflamed against the woman who
made their mother weep, assailed their aunt with the
refined tortures of misbehaved children, mingled with
the fiendish cruelty of little savages. After several
patched-up truces it became necessary to part. Mademoiselle
de Varandeuil decided to leave her brother, for
she saw how unhappy he was amid this daily wrenching
of his dearest affections. She left him to his wife
and his children. This separation was one of the great
sorrows of her life. She who was so strong against
emotion and so self-contained, and who seemed to take
pride in suffering, as it were, almost broke down when
she had to leave the apartment, where she had dreamed
of enjoying a little happiness in her corner, looking on
at the happiness of others: her last tears mounted to her
eyes.</p>

<p>She did not go too far away, so that she might be at
hand to nurse her brother if he were ill, and to see him
and meet him sometimes. But there was a great void
in her heart and in her life. She had begun to visit
her kinsfolk since her father's death: she drew nearer
to them; she allowed the relatives whom the Restoration
had placed in a lofty and powerful position to come
to her, and sought out those whom the new order of
things left in obscurity and poverty. But she returned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
to her dear <i>chick</i> first of all, and to another distant
cousin, also married, who had become the <i>chick's</i> sister-in-law.
Her relations with her kinsfolk soon assumed
remarkable regularity. Mademoiselle de Varandeuil
never went into society, to an evening party, or to the
play. It required Mademoiselle Rachel's brilliant success
to persuade her to step inside a theatre; she ventured
there but twice. She never accepted an invitation
to a large dinner-party. But there were two or three
houses where, as at the <i>chick's</i>, she would invite herself
to dine, unexpectedly, when there were no guests. "My
love," she would say without ceremony, "are you and
your husband doing nothing this evening? Then I
will stay and eat some of your ragoût." At eight
o'clock regularly she rose to go, and when the husband
took his hat to escort her home, she would knock it out
of his hands with a: "Nonsense! an old nanny-goat
like me! Why, I frighten men in the street!" And
then ten days or a fortnight would pass, during which
they would not see her. But if anything went wrong,
if there was a death or sickness in the house, Mademoiselle
de Varandeuil always heard of it at once, no
one knew how; she would come, in spite of everything&mdash;the
weather or the hour&mdash;would give a loud ring at
the bell in her own way&mdash;they finally called it <i>cousin's
ring</i>&mdash;and a moment later, relieved of her umbrella,
which never left her, and of her pattens, her hat tossed
upon a chair, she was at the service of those who needed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
her. She listened, talked, restored their courage with
an indescribable martial accent, with language as energetic
as a soldier might use to console a wounded comrade,
and stimulating as a cordial. If it was a child that
was out of sorts, she would go straight to the bed, laugh
at the little one, whose fear vanished at once, order the
father and mother about, run hither and thither, assume
the management of everything, apply the leeches,
arrange the cataplasms, and bring back hope, joy and
health at the double quick. In all branches of the
family the old maid appeared thus providentially, without
warning, on days of sorrow, <i>ennui</i> and suffering.
She was never seen except when her hands were needed
to heal, her devoted friendship to console. She was,
so to speak, an impersonal creature, because of her
great heart; a woman who did not belong to herself:
God seemed to have made her only to give her to others.
Her everlasting black dress which she persisted in wearing,
her worn, dyed shawl, her absurd hat, her impoverished
appearance, were, in her eyes, the means of
being rich enough to help others with her little fortune;
she was extravagant in almsgiving, and her pockets were
always filled with gifts for the poor; not of money, for
she feared the wineshop, but of four-pound loaves which
she bought for them at the baker's. And then, too, by
dint of living in poverty, she was able to give herself
what was to her the greatest of all luxuries: the joy of
her friends' children whom she overwhelmed with New<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
Year's and other gifts, with surprises and pleasures of all
sorts. For instance, suppose that one of them had been
left by his mother, who was absent from Paris, to pass a
lovely summer Sunday at his boarding school, and the
little rascal, out of spite, had misbehaved so that he was
not allowed to go out. How surprised he would be, as
the clock struck nine, to see his old cousin appear in the
courtyard, just buttoning the last button of her dress,
she had come in such haste. And what a feeling of
desolation at the sight! "Cousin," he would say piteously,
in one of those fits of passion in which at the
same moment you long to cry and to kill your <i>tyrant</i>,
"I&mdash;I am kept in, and&mdash;&mdash;" "Kept in? Oh! yes, kept
in! And do you suppose I've taken all this trouble&mdash;&mdash;Is
your schoolmaster poking fun at me? Where is the
puppy, that I may have a word with him? You go and
dress yourself meanwhile. Off with you!" And the
child, not daring to hope that a woman so shabbily
dressed would have the power to raise the embargo,
would suddenly feel a hand upon his arm, and the cousin
would carry him off, toss him into a cab, all bewildered
and dumfounded with joy, and take him to the Bois de
Boulogne. She would let him ride a donkey all day
long, urging the beast on with a broken branch, and
crying: "Get up!" And then, after a good dinner at
Borne's, she would take him back to school, and, under
the porte-cochère, as she kissed him she would slip a big
hundred-sou piece into his hand.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>Strange old maid. The bitter experiences of her
whole existence, the struggle to live, the never-ending
physical suffering, the long-continued bodily and mental
torture had, as it were, cut her loose from life and placed
her above it. Her education, the things she had seen,
the spectacle of what seemed the end of everything, the
Revolution, had so formed her character as to lead her
to disdain human suffering. And this old woman, who
had nothing left of life save breath, had risen to a serene
philosophy, to a virile, haughty, almost satirical stoicism.
Sometimes she would begin to declaim against a sorrow
that seemed a little too keen; but, in the midst of her
tirade, she would suddenly hurl an angry, mocking word
at herself, upon which her face would at once become
calm. She was cheerful with the cheerfulness of a deep,
bubbling spring, the cheerfulness of devoted hearts that
have seen everything, of the old soldier or the old hospital
nurse. Kind-hearted to admiration she was, and
yet something was lacking in her kindness of heart: forgiveness.
Hitherto, she had never succeeded in moving
or bending her character. A slight, an unkind action, a
trifle, if it touched her heart, wounded her forever. She
forgot nothing. Time, death itself, did not disarm her
memory.</p>

<p>Of religion, she had none. Born at a period when
women did without it, she had grown to womanhood at
a time when there were no churches. Mass did not
exist when she was a young maid. There had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
nothing to accustom her to the thought of God or to
make her feel the need of Him, and she had retained a
sort of shrinking hatred for priests, which must have
been connected with some family secret of which she
never spoke. Her faith, her strength, her piety, all
consisted in the pride of her conscience; she considered
that if she retained her own esteem, she could be sure
of acting rightly and of never failing in her duty. She
was thus singularly constituted by the two epochs in
which she had lived, a compound of the two, dipped in
the opposing currents of the old régime and the Revolution.
After Louis XVI. failed to take horse on the
Tenth of August, she lost her regard for kings; but she
detested the mob. She desired equality and she held
parvenus in horror. She was a republican and an aristocrat,
combined scepticism with prejudice, the horrors
of '93, which she saw, with the vague and noble theories
of humanity which surrounded her cradle.</p>

<p>Her external qualities were altogether masculine. She
had the sharp voice, the freedom of speech, the unruly
tongue of the old woman of the eighteenth century,
heightened by an accent suggestive of the common
people, a mannish, highly colored style of elocution
peculiar to herself, rising above modesty in the choice of
words and fearless in calling things baldly by their plain
names.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the years rolled on, sweeping away the
Restoration and the monarchy of Louis-Philippe. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
saw all those whom she had loved go from her one by
one, all her family take the road to the cemetery. She
was left quite alone, and she marveled and was grieved
that death should forget her, who would have offered so
little resistance, for she was already leaning over the
grave and was obliged to force her heart down to the
level of the little children brought to her by the sons
and daughters of the friends whom she had lost. Her
brother was dead. Her dear <i>chick</i> was no more. The
<i>chick's</i> sister-in-law alone was left to her. But hers was
a life that hung trembling in the balance, ready to fly
away. Crushed by the death of a child for whom she
had waited for years, the poor woman was dying of consumption.
Mademoiselle de Varandeuil was in her bedroom
every day, from noon until six o'clock, for four
years. She lived by her side all that time, in the close
atmosphere and the odor of constant fumigations. She
did not allow herself to be kept away for one hour by
her own gout and rheumatism, but gave her time and
her life to the peaceful last hours of that dying woman,
whose eyes were fixed upon heaven, where her dead
children awaited her. And when, in the cemetery,
Mademoiselle de Varandeuil had turned aside the
shroud to kiss the dead face for the last time, it seemed
to her as if there were no one near to her, as if she were
all alone upon the earth.</p>

<p>Thenceforth, yielding to the infirmities which she had
no further reason to shake off, she began to live the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
narrow, confined life of old people who wear out their
carpet in one spot only&mdash;never leaving her room, reading
but little because it tired her eyes, and passing most of
her time buried in her easy-chair, reviewing the past and
living it over again. She would sit in the same position
for days, her eyes wide open and dreaming, her thoughts
far from herself, far from the room in which she sat,
journeying whither her memories led her, to distant
faces, dearly loved, pallid faces, to vanished regions&mdash;lost
in a profound lethargy which Germinie was careful
not to disturb, saying to herself: "Madame is in her
meditations&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>One day in every week, however, she went abroad.
Indeed it was with that weekly excursion in view, in
order to be nearer the spot to which she wished to go
on that one day, that she left her apartments on Rue
Taitbout and took up her abode on Rue de Laval. One
day in every week, deterred by nothing, not even by
illness, she repaired to the Montmartre Cemetery, where
her father and her brother rested, and the women whose
loss she regretted, all those whose sufferings had come to
an end before hers. For the dead and for Death she displayed
a veneration almost equal to that of the ancients.
To her, the grave was sacred, and a dear friend. She loved
to visit the land of hope and deliverance where her dear
ones were sleeping, there to await death and to be ready
with her body. On that day, she would start early in
the morning, leaning on the arm of her maid, who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
carried a folding-stool. As she drew near the cemetery,
she would enter the shop of a dealer in wreaths, who
had known her for many years, and who, in winter,
loaned her a foot-warmer. There she would rest a few
moments; then, loading Germinie down with wreaths of
immortelles, she would pass through the cemetery gate,
take the path to the left of the cedar at the entrance,
and make her pilgrimage slowly from tomb to tomb.
She would throw away the withered flowers, sweep up
the dead leaves, tie the wreaths together, and, sitting
down upon her folding-chair, would gaze and dream,
and absent-mindedly remove a bit of moss from the flat
stone with the end of her umbrella. Then she would
rise, turn as if to say <i>au revoir</i> to the tomb she was
leaving, walk away, stop once more, and talk in an
undertone, as she had done before, with that part of her
that was sleeping under the stone; and having thus paid
a visit to all the dead who lived in her affections, she
would return home slowly and reverentially, enveloping
herself in silence as if she were afraid to speak.</p>



<hr />
<h2 class="chapter">III</h2>


<p>In the course of her reverie, Mademoiselle de Varandeuil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
had closed her eyes.</p>

<p>The maid's story ceased, and the remainder of the
history of her life, which was upon her lips that evening,
was once more buried in her heart.</p>

<p>The conclusion of her story was as follows:</p>

<p>When little Germinie Lacerteux arrived in Paris,
being then less than fifteen years old, her sister, desirous
to have her begin to earn her living at once, and to help
to put bread in her hand, obtained a place for her in a
small café on the boulevard, where she performed the
double duties of lady's maid to the mistress of the café
and assistant to the waiters in carrying on the main
business of the establishment. The child, just from her
village and dropped suddenly in that place, was completely
bewildered and terrified by her surroundings and
her duties. She had the first instinctive feeling of
wounded modesty and, foreshadowing the woman she
was destined to become, she shuddered at the perpetual
contact with the other sex, working, eating, passing
her whole time with men; and whenever she had an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
opportunity to go out, and went to her sisters, there were
tearful, despairing scenes, when, without actually complaining
of anything, she manifested a sort of dread to
return, saying that she did not want to stay there, that
they were not satisfied with her, that she preferred to
return to them. They would reply that it had already
cost them enough to bring her to Paris, that it was a
silly whim on her part and that she was very well off
where she was, and they would send her back to the
café in tears. She dared not tell all that she suffered in
the company of the waiters in the café, insolent, boasting,
cynical fellows, fed on the remains of debauches,
tainted with all the vices to which they ministered, and
corrupt to the core with putrefying odds and ends of
obscenity. At every turn, she had to submit to the
dastardly jests, the cruel mystifications, the malicious
tricks of these scoundrels, who were only too happy to
make a little martyr of the poor unsophisticated child,
ignorant of everything, with the crushed and sickly air,
timid and sullen, thin and pale, and pitiably clad in her
wretched, countrified gowns. Bewildered, overwhelmed,
so to speak, by this hourly torture, she became their
drudge. They made sport of her ignorance, they deceived
her and abused her credulity by absurd fables,
they overburdened her with fatiguing tasks, they assailed
her with incessant, pitiless ridicule, which well-nigh
drove her benumbed intellect to imbecility. In addition,
they made her blush at the things they said to her, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
made her feel ashamed, although she did not understand
them. They soiled the artlessness of her fourteen years
with filthy veiled allusions. And they found amusement
in putting the eyes of her childish curiosity to the keyholes
of the private supper-rooms.</p>

<p>The little one longed to confide in her sisters, but she
dared not. When, with nourishing food, her body took
on a little flesh, her cheeks a little color and she began
to have something of the aspect of a woman, they took
great liberties with her and grew bolder. There were
attempts at familiarity, significant gestures, advances,
which she eluded, and from which she escaped unscathed,
but which assailed her purity by breathing upon her
innocence. Roughly treated, scolded, reviled by the
master of the establishment, who was accustomed to
abuse his maidservants and who bore her a grudge
because she was not old enough or of the right sort for
a mistress, she found no support, no touch of humanity,
except in his wife. She began to love that woman with
a sort of animal devotion, and to obey her with the
docility of a dog. She did all her errands without
thought or reflection. She carried her letters to her
lovers and was very clever about delivering them. She
became very active and agile and ingenuously sly in
passing in and out, evading the awakened suspicions of
the husband; and without any clear idea of what she
was doing or of what she was concealing, she felt a
mischievous delight, such as children and monkeys feel,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
in telling herself vaguely that she was causing some
little suffering to that man and that house, which caused
her so much. There was among her comrades an old
waiter, named Joseph, who defended her, warned her of
the cruel plots concocted against her, and, when she was
present, put a stop to conversation that was too free, with
the authority of his white hairs and his paternal interest
in the girl. Meanwhile Germinie's horror of the house
increased every day. One week her sisters were compelled
to take her back to the café by force.</p>

<p>A few days later, there was a great review on the
Champ de Mars, and the waiters had leave of absence
for the day. Only Germinie and old Joseph remained
in the house. Joseph was at work sorting soiled linen in
a small, dark room. He told Germinie to come and help
him. She entered the room; she cried out, fell to the
floor, wept, implored, struggled, called desperately for
help. The empty house was deaf.</p>

<p>When she recovered consciousness, Germinie ran and
shut herself up in her chamber. She was not seen again
that day. On the following day, when Joseph walked
toward her and attempted to speak to her, she recoiled
from him in dismay, with the gesture of a woman mad
with fear. For a long time, whenever a man approached
her, her first involuntary impulse was to draw back
suddenly, trembling and nervous, like a terrified, bewildered
beast, looking about for means of flight.
Joseph, who feared that she would denounce him, allowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
her to keep him at a distance, and respected the horrible
repugnance she exhibited for him.</p>

<p>She became <i>enceinte</i>. One Sunday she had been to
pass the evening with her sister, the concierge; she had
an attack of vomiting, followed by severe pain. A
physician who occupied an apartment in the house, came
to the lodge for his key, and the sisters learned from him
the secret of their younger sister's condition. The brutal,
intractable pride of the common people in their honor,
the implacable severity of rigid piety, flew to arms in the
two women and found vent in fierce indignation. Their
bewilderment changed to fury. Germinie recovered
consciousness under their blows, their insults, the wounds
inflicted by their hands, the harsh words that came from
their mouths. Her brother-in-law was there, who had
never forgiven her the cost of her journey; he glanced at
her with a bantering expression, with the cunning, ferocious
joy of an Auvergnat, with a sneering laugh that dyed
the girl's cheeks a deeper red than her sisters' blows.</p>

<p>She received the blows, she did not repel the insults.
She sought neither to defend nor to excuse herself. She
did not tell what had taken place and how little her own
desires had had to do with her misfortune. She was
dumb: she had a vague hope that they would kill her.
When her older sister asked her if there had been no
violence, and reminded her that there were police officers
and courts, she closed her eyes at the thought of publishing
her shame. For one instant only, when her mother's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
memory was cast in her face, she emitted a glance, a
lightning flash from her eyes, by which the two women
felt their consciences pierced; they remembered that
they were the ones who had placed her and kept her in
that den, and had exposed her to the danger, nay, had
almost forced her into her misfortune.</p>

<p>That same evening, the younger of Germinie's sisters
took her to the Rue Saint-Martin, to the house of a
repairer of cashmere shawls, with whom she lodged, and
who, being almost daft on the subject of religion, was
banner-bearer in a sisterhood of the Virgin. She made
her lie beside her on a mattress on the floor, and having
her there under her hand all night, she vented upon her
all her long-standing, venomous jealousy, her bitter
resentment at the preference, the caresses given Germinie
by her father and mother. It was a long succession of
petty tortures, brutal or hypocritical exhibitions of spite,
kicks that bruised her legs, and progressive movements
of the body by which she gradually forced her companion
out of bed&mdash;it was a cold winter's night&mdash;to the floor of
the fireless room. During the day, the seamstress took
Germinie in hand, catechized her, preached at her, and
by detailing the tortures of the other life, inspired in her
mind a horrible fear of the hell whose flames she caused
her to feel.</p>

<p>She lived there four months, in close confinement, and
was never allowed to leave the house. At the end of
four months she gave birth to a dead child. When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
her health was restored, she entered the service of a
depilator on Rue Laffitte, and for the first few days she
had the joyful feeling of having been released from
prison. Two or three times, in her walks, she met old
Joseph who ran after her and wanted to marry her; but
she escaped him and the old man never knew that he
had been a father.</p>

<p>But soon Germinie began to pine away in her new
place. The house where she had taken service as a
maid of all work was what servants call "a barrack."
A spendthrift and glutton, devoid of order as of money,
as is often the case with women engaged in the occupations
that depend upon chance, and in the problematical
methods of gaining a livelihood in vogue in Paris, the
depilator, who was almost always involved in a lawsuit
of some sort, paid but little heed to her small servant's
nourishment. She often went away for the whole day
without leaving her any dinner. The little one would
satisfy her appetite as well as she could with some kind
of uncooked food, salads, vinegary things that deceive a
young woman's appetite, even charcoal, which she would
nibble with the depraved taste and capricious stomach of
her age and sex. This diet, just after recovering from
her confinement, her health being but partially restored
and greatly in need of stimulants, exhausted the young
woman's strength, reduced her flesh and undermined
her constitution. She had a terrifying aspect. Her complexion
changed to that dead white that looks green in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
the daylight. Her swollen eyes were surrounded with a
great, bluish shadow. Her discolored lips assumed the
hue of faded violets. Her breath failed her at the
slightest ascent, and the incessant vibrating sound that
came from the arteries of her throat was painful to those
near her. With heavy feet and enfeebled body, she
dragged herself along, as if life were too heavy a burden
for her. Her faculties and her senses were so torpid
that she swooned for no cause at all, for so small a
matter as the fatigue of combing her mistress's hair.</p>

<p>She was silently drooping there when her sister found
her another place, with a former actor, a retired comedian,
living upon the money that the laughter of all
Paris had brought him. The good man was old and
had never had any children. He took pity on the
wretched girl, interested himself in her welfare, took
care of her and made much of her. He took her into
the country. He walked with her on the boulevards in
the sunlight, and enjoyed the warmth the more for leaning
on her arm. It delighted him to see her in good
spirits. Often, to amuse her, he would take down a
moth-eaten costume from his wardrobe and try to
remember a fragment of some part that had gone from
his memory. The mere sight of this little maid and her
white cap was like a ray of returning youth to him. In
his old age, Jocrisse leaned upon her with the good-fellowship,
the pleasures and the childish fancies of a
grandfather's heart. But he died after a few months,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
and Germinie had fallen back into the service of kept
mistresses, boarding-house keepers, and passageway
tradesmen, when the sudden death of a maidservant
gave her an opportunity to enter the service of Mademoiselle
de Varandeuil, then living on Rue Taitbout,
in the house of which her sister was concierge.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>



<hr />
<h2 class="chapter">IV</h2>


<p>Those people who look for the death of the Catholic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
religion in our day, do not realize by what an infinite
number of sturdy roots it still retains its hold upon the
hearts of the people. They do not realize the secret,
delicate fascination it has for the woman of the people.
They do not realize what confession and the confessor
are to the impoverished souls of those poor women. In
the priest who listens and whose voice falls softly on her
ear, the woman of toil and suffering sees not so much
the minister of God, the judge of her sins, the arbiter of
her welfare, as the confidant of her sorrows and the
friend of her misery. However coarse she may be, there
is always a little of the true woman in her, a feverish,
trembling, sensitive, wounded something, a restlessness
and, as it were, the sighing of an invalid who craves
caressing words, even as a child's trifling ailments
require the nurse's droning lullaby. She, as well as
the woman of the world, must have the consolation
of pouring out her heart, of confiding her troubles
to a sympathetic ear. For it is the nature of her
sex to seek an outlet for the emotions and an arm to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
lean upon. There are in her mind things that she must
tell, and concerning which she would like to be questioned,
pitied and comforted. She dreams of a compassionate
interest, a tender sympathy for hidden feelings
of which she is ashamed. Her masters may be the
kindest, the most friendly, the most approachable of
masters to the woman in their employ: their kindness
to her will still be of the same sort that they bestow upon
a domestic animal. They will be uneasy concerning
her appetite and her health; they will look carefully
after the animal part of her, and that will be all. It
will not occur to them that she can suffer elsewhere
than in her body, and they will not dream that she can
have the heartache, the sadness and immaterial pain for
which they seek relief by confiding in those of their own
station. In their eyes, the woman who sweeps and does
the cooking, has no ideas that can cause her to be sad
or thoughtful, and they never speak to her of her
thoughts. To whom, then, shall she carry them? To
the priest who is waiting for them, asks for them, welcomes
them, to the churchman who is also a man of the
world, a superior creature, a well-educated gentleman,
who knows everything, speaks well, is always accessible,
gentle, patient, attentive, and seems to feel no scorn for
the most humble soul, the most shabbily dressed penitent.
The priest alone listens to the woman in a cap.
He alone takes an interest in her secret sufferings, in
the things that disturb and agitate her and that bring to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
a maid, as well as to her mistress, the sudden longing to
weep, or excite a tempest within her. There is none
but he to encourage her outpourings, to draw from her
those things which the irony of her daily life holds back,
to look to the state of her moral health; none but he
to raise her above her material life, none but he to
cheer her with moving words of charity and hope,&mdash;such
divine words as she has never heard from the mouths
of the men of her family and of her class.</p>

<p>After entering the service of Mademoiselle de Varandeuil,
Germinie became profoundly religious and cared for
nothing but the church. She abandoned herself little
by little to the sweet delight of confession, to the priest's
smooth, tranquil bass voice that came to her from the
darkness, to the conversations which resembled the touch
of soothing words, and from which she went forth
refreshed, light of heart, free from care, and happy
with a delightful sense of relief, as if a balm had been
applied to all the tender, suffering, fettered portions of
her being.</p>

<p>She did not, could not, open her heart elsewhere.
Her mistress had a certain masculine roughness of
demeanor which repelled expansiveness. She had an
abrupt, exclamatory way of speaking that forced back
all that Germinie would have liked to confide to her.
It was in her nature to be brutal in her treatment of all
lamentations that were not caused by pain or disappointment.
Her virile kindliness had no pity to spare for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
diseases of the imagination, for the suffering that is
created by the thought, for the weariness of spirit that
flows from a woman's nerves and from the disordered
condition of her mental organism. Germinie often
found her unfeeling; the old woman had simply been
hardened by the times in which she had lived and by
the circumstances of her life. The shell of her heart
was as hard as her body. Never complaining herself,
she did not like to hear complaints about her. And by
the right of all the tears she had not shed, she detested
childish tears in grown persons.</p>

<p>Soon the confessional became a sort of sacred, idolized
rendezvous for Germinie's thoughts. Every day it
was her first idea, the theme of her first prayer. Throughout
the day, she was kneeling there as in a dream; and
while she was about her work it was constantly before
her eyes, with its oaken frame with fillets of gold, its
pediment in the shape of a winged angel's head, its
green curtain with the motionless folds, and the mysterious
darkness on both sides. It seemed to her that now
her whole life centred there, and that every hour tended
thither. She lived through the week looking forward to
that longed-for, prayed-for, promised day. On Thursday,
she began to be impatient; she felt, in the redoubling
of her blissful agony, the material drawing
near, as it were, of the blessed Saturday evening; and
when Saturday came and mademoiselle's dinner had
been hastily served and her work done, she would make<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
her escape and run to Notre-Dame de Lorette, hurrying
to the penitential stool as to a lover's rendezvous. Her
fingers dipped in holy water and a genuflexion duly
made, she would glide over the flags, between the rows
of chairs, as softly as a cat steals across a carpeted floor.
With bent head, almost crawling, she would go noiselessly
forward in the shadow of the side aisles, until she
reached the mysterious, veiled confessional, where she
would pause and await her turn, absorbed in the emotion
of suspense.</p>

<p>The young priest who confessed her, encouraged her
frequent confessions. He was not sparing of time or
attention or charity. He allowed her to talk at great
length and tell him, with many words, of all her petty
troubles. He was indulgent to the diffuseness of a suffering
soul, and permitted her to pour out freely her
most trivial afflictions. He listened while she set forth
her anxieties, her longings, her troubles; he did not
repel or treat with scorn any portion of the confidences
of a servant who spoke to him of all the most delicate,
secret concerns of her existence, as one would speak to
a mother and a physician.</p>

<p>This priest was young. He was kind-hearted. He
had lived in the world. A great sorrow had impelled
him, crushed and broken, to assume the gown wherein
he wore mourning for his heart. There remained something
of the man in the depths of his being, and he
listened, with melancholy compassion, to the outpouring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
of this maidservant's suffering heart. He understood
that Germinie needed him, that he sustained and
strengthened her, that he saved her from herself and
removed her from the temptations to which her nature
exposed her. He was conscious of a sad sympathy for
that heart overflowing with affection, for the ardent, yet
tractable girl, for the unhappy creature who knew nothing
of her own nature, who was promised to passion by
every impulse of her heart, by her whole body, and who
betrayed in every detail of her person the vocation of
her temperament. Enlightened by his past experience,
he was amazed and terrified sometimes by the gleams
that emanated from her, by the flame that shot from her
eyes at the outburst of love in a prayer, by the evident
tendency of her confessions, by her constantly recurring
to that scene of violence, that scene in which her perfectly
sincere purpose to resist seemed to the priest to
have been betrayed by a convulsion of the senses that
was stronger than she.</p>

<p>This fever of religion lasted several years, during
which Germinie lived a concentrated, silent, happy life,
entirely devoted to God's service&mdash;at least she thought
so. Her confessor, however, had come gradually to the
conclusion that all her adoration tended toward himself.
By her glances, by her blushes, by the words she no
longer said to him, and by others which she made bold
to say to him for the first time, he realized that his
penitent's devotion was going astray and becoming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
unduly fervent, deceiving itself as to its object. She
watched for him when the services were at an end, followed
him into the sacristy, hung on his skirts, ran into
the church after his cassock. The confessor tried to
warn her, to divert her amorous fervor from himself.
He became more reserved and assumed a cold demeanor.
In despair at this change, at his apparent indifference,
Germinie, feeling bitter and hurt, confessed to him one
day, in the confessional, the hatred that had taken possession
of her for two young girls, who were his favorite
penitents. Thereupon the priest dismissed her, without
discussion, and sent her to another confessor. Germinie
went once or twice to confess to this other confessor;
then she ceased to go; soon she ceased even to think of
going, and of all her religion naught remained in her
mind but a certain far-off sweetness, like the faint odor
of burned-out incense.</p>

<p>Affairs had reached that point when mademoiselle
fell ill. Throughout her illness, as Germinie did not
want to leave her, she did not attend mass. And on the
first Sunday&mdash;when mademoiselle, being fully recovered,
did not require her care, she was greatly surprised to find
that "her devotee" remained at home and did not run
away to church.</p>

<p>"Oho!" said she, "so you don't go and see your
curés nowadays? What have they done to you, eh?"</p>

<p>"Nothing," said Germinie.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span></p>



<hr />
<h2 class="chapter">V</h2>


<p>"There, mademoiselle!&mdash;Look at me," said Germinie.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>It was a few months later. She had asked her mistress's
permission to go that evening to the wedding ball
of her grocer's sister, who had chosen her for her maid-of-honor,
and she had come to exhibit herself <i>en grande
toilette</i>, in her low-necked muslin dress.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle raised her eyes from the old volume,
printed in large type, which she was reading, removed
her spectacles, placed them in the book to mark her
place, and exclaimed:</p>

<p>"What, my little bigot, you at a ball! Do you know,
my girl, this seems to me downright nonsense! You
and the hornpipe! Faith, all you need now is to want
to get married! A deuce of a want, that! But if you
marry, I warn you that I won't keep you&mdash;mind that!
I've no desire to wait on your brats! Come a little
nearer&mdash;&mdash;Oho! why&mdash;&mdash;bless my soul! Mademoiselle
Show-all! We're getting to be a bit of a flirt
lately, I find&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Why no, mademoiselle," Germinie tried to say.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span></p>

<p>"And then," continued Mademoiselle de Varandeuil,
following out her thought, "among you people, the men
are such sweet creatures! They'll spend all you have&mdash;to
say nothing of the blows. But marriage&mdash;I am sure
that that nonsensical idea of getting married buzzes
around in your head when you see the others. That's
what gives you that simper, I'll wager. <i>Bon Dieu de
Dieu!</i> Now turn a bit, so that I can see you," said
Mademoiselle de Varandeuil, with an abrupt change of
tone to one that was almost caressing; and placing her
thin hands on the arms of her easy-chair, crossing her
legs and moving her foot back and forth, she set about
inspecting Germinie and her toilet.</p>

<p>"What the devil!" said she, after a few moments of
silent scrutiny, "what! is it really you?&mdash;&mdash;Then I
have never used my eyes to look at you.&mdash;&mdash;Good
God, yes!&mdash;--But&mdash;&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash;" She mumbled
more vague exclamations between her teeth.&mdash;&mdash;"Where
the deuce did you get that mug like an amorous
cat's?" she said at last, and continued to gaze at
her.</p>

<p>Germinie was ugly. Her hair, of so dark a chestnut
that it seemed black, curled and twisted in unruly waves,
in little stiff, rebellious locks, which escaped and stood
up all over her head, despite the pomade upon her
shiny <i>bandeaux</i>. Her smooth, narrow, swelling brow
protruded above the shadow of the deep sockets in which
her eyes were buried and sunken to such a depth as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
almost to denote disease; small, bright, sparkling eyes
they were, made to seem smaller and brighter by a constant
girlish twinkle that softened and lighted up their
laughter. They were neither brown eyes nor blue eyes,
but were of an undefinable, changing gray, a gray that
was not a color, but a light! Emotion found expression
therein in the flame of fever, pleasure in the flashing
rays of a sort of intoxication, passion in phosphorescence.
Her short, turned-up nose, with large, dilated,
palpitating nostrils, was one of those noses of which the
common people say that it rains inside: upon one side,
at the corner of the eye was a thick, swollen blue vein.
The square head of the Lorraine race was emphasized in
her broad, high, prominent cheek-bones, which were well-covered
with the traces of small-pox. The most noticeable
defect in her face was the too great distance
between the nose and mouth. This lack of proportion
gave an almost apish character to the lower part of the
head, where the expansive mouth, with white teeth and
full lips that looked as if they had been crushed, they
were so flat, smiled at you with a strange, vaguely irritating
smile.</p>

<p>Her <i>décolleté</i> dress disclosed her neck, the upper part
of her breast, her shoulders and her white back, presenting
a striking contrast to her swarthy face. It was a
lymphatic sort of whiteness, the whiteness, at once
unhealthy and angelic, of flesh in which there is no life.
She had let her arms fall by her sides&mdash;round, smooth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
arms with a pretty dimple at the elbow. Her wrists
were delicate; her hands, which did not betray the
servant, were embellished with a lady's fingernails. And
lazily, with graceful sloth, she allowed her indolent
figure to curve and sway;&mdash;a figure that a garter might
span, and that was made even more slender to the eye
by the projection of the hips and the curve of the hoops
that gave the balloon-like roundness to her skirt;&mdash;an
impossible waist, absurdly small but adorable, like everything
in woman that offends one's sense of proportion
by its diminutiveness.</p>

<p>From this ugly woman emanated a piquant, mysterious
charm. Light and shadow, jostling and intercepting
each other on her face on which hollows and protuberances
abounded, imparted to it that suggestion of libertinism
which the painter of love scenes gives to the
rough sketch of his mistress. Everything about her,&mdash;her
mouth, her eyes, her very plainness&mdash;was instinct with
allurement and solicitation. Her person exhaled an
aphrodisiac charm, which challenged and laid fast hold
of the other sex. It unloosed desire, and caused an
electric shock. Sensual thoughts were naturally and
involuntarily aroused by her, by her gestures, her gait,
her slightest movement&mdash;even by the air in which her
body had left one of its undulations. Beside her, one
felt as if he were near one of those disturbing, disquieting
creatures, burning with the love disease and
communicating it to others, whose face appears to man<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
in his restless hours, torments his listless noonday
thoughts, haunts his nights and trespasses upon his
dreams.</p>

<p>In the midst of Mademoiselle de Varandeuil's scrutiny,
Germinie stooped over her, and covered her hand with
hurried kisses.</p>

<p>"There&mdash;there&mdash;enough of that," said Mademoiselle.
"You would soon wear out the skin&mdash;with your way of
kissing. Come, run along, enjoy yourself, and try not
to stay out too late. Don't get all tired out."</p>

<p>Mademoiselle de Varandeuil was left alone. She placed
her elbows on her knees, stared at the fire and stirred
the burning wood with the tongs. Then, as she was
accustomed to do when deeply preoccupied, she struck
herself two or three sharp little blows on the neck with
the flat of her hand, and thereby set her black cap all
awry.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>




<hr />
<h2 class="chapter">VI</h2>


<p>When she mentioned the subject of marriage to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
Germinie, Mademoiselle de Varandeuil touched upon the
real cause of her trouble. She placed her hand upon
the seat of her <i>ennui</i>. Her maid's uneven temper, her
distaste for life, the languor, the emptiness, the discontent
of her existence, arose from that disease which
medical science calls the <i>melancholia of virgins</i>. The
torment of her twenty-four years was the ardent, excited,
poignant longing for marriage, for that state which was
too holy and honorable for her, and which seemed
impossible of attainment in face of the confession her
womanly probity would insist upon making of her fall
and her unworthiness. Family losses and misfortunes
forcibly diverted her mind from her own troubles.</p>

<p>Her brother-in-law, her sister the concierge's husband,
had dreamed the dream of all Auvergnats: he
had undertaken to increase his earnings as concierge by
the profits of a dealer in bric-à-brac. He had begun
modestly with a stall in the street, at the doors of the
marts where executors' sales are held; and there you
could see, set out upon blue paper, plated candlesticks,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
ivory napkin rings, colored lithographs with frames of
gold lace on a black ground, and three or four odd
volumes of Buffon. His profit on the plated candlesticks
intoxicated him. He hired a dark shop on a
passage way, opposite an umbrella mender's, and began
to trade upon the credulity that goes in and out of the
lower rooms in the Auction Exchange. He sold <i>assiettes
à coq</i>, pieces of Jean Jacques Rousseau's wooden shoe,
and water-colors by Ballue, signed Watteau. In that
business he threw away what he had made, and ran in
debt to the amount of several thousand francs. His
wife, in order to straighten matters out a little and to
try and get out of debt, asked for and obtained a place
as box-opener at the <i>Théâtre-Historique</i>. She hired
her sister the dressmaker to watch the door in the evening,
went to bed at one o'clock and was astir again at
five. After a few months she caught cold in the corridors
of the theatre, and an attack of pleurisy laid her
low and carried her off in six weeks. The poor woman
left a little girl three years old, who was taken down
with the measles; the disease assumed its most malignant
form in the foul stench of the loft, where the child
had breathed for more than a month air poisoned by
the breath of her dying mother. The father had gone
into the country to try and borrow money. He married
again there. Nothing more was heard of him.</p>

<p>When returning from her sister's burial Germinie ran
to the house of an old woman who made a living in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
those curious industries which prevent poverty from
absolutely starving to death in Paris. This old woman
carried on several trades. Sometimes she cut bristles
into equal lengths for brushes, sometimes she sorted out
bits of gingerbread. When those industries failed, she
did cooking and washed the faces of pedlars' children.
In Lent she rose at four o'clock in the morning, went
and took possession of a chair at Notre-Dame, and sold
it for ten or twelve sous when the crowd arrived. In
order to procure fuel to warm herself, in the den where
she lived on Rue Saint-Victor, she would go, at nightfall,
to the Luxembourg and peel the bark off the trees.
Germinie, who knew her from having given her the
crusts from the kitchen every week, hired a servant's
room on the sixth floor of the house, and took up her
abode there with the little one. She did it on the impulse
of the moment, without reflection. She did not
remember her sister's harsh treatment of her when she
was <i>enceinte</i>, so that she had no need to forgive it.</p>

<p>Thenceforth Germinie had but one thought, her
niece. She determined to rescue her from death and
restore her to life by dint of careful nursing. She would
rush away from Mademoiselle at every moment, run up
the stairs to the sixth floor four at a time, kiss the child,
give her her draught, arrange her comfortably in bed,
look at her, and rush down again, all out of breath and
red with pleasure. Care, caresses, the breath from the
heart with which we revive a tiny flame on the point of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
dying out, consultations, doctor's visits, costly medicines,
the remedies of the wealthy,&mdash;Germinie spared
nothing for the little one and gave her everything. Her
wages flowed through that channel. For almost a year
she gave her beef juice every morning: sleepyhead that
she was, she left her bed at five o'clock in the morning
to prepare it, and awoke without being called, as
mothers do. The child was out of danger at last, when
Germinie received a visit one morning from her sister
the dressmaker, who had been married two or three
years to a machinist, and who came now to bid her
adieu: her husband was going to accompany some
fellow-workmen who had been hired to go to Africa.
She was going with him and she proposed to Germinie
that they should take the little one with them as a playmate
for their own child. They offered to take her off
her hands. Germinie, they said, would have to pay only
for the journey. It was a separation she would have
to make up her mind to sooner or later on account of
her mistress. And then, said the sister, she was the
child's aunt too. And she heaped words upon words
to induce Germinie to give them the child, with whom
she and her husband expected, after their arrival in
Africa, to move Germinie to pity, to get possession of
her wages, to play upon her heart and her purse.</p>

<p>It cost Germinie very dear to part with her niece.
She had staked a portion of her existence upon the child.
She was attached to her by her anxiety and her sacrifices.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
She had disputed possession of her with disease and had
won the day; the girl's life was her miracle. And yet she
realized that she could never take her to mademoiselle's
apartments; that mademoiselle, at her age, with the burden
of her years, and an aged person's need of tranquillity,
could never endure the constant noise and movement
of a child. And then, the little girl's presence in
the house would cause idle gossip and set the whole
street agog: people would say she was her child. Germinie
made a confidante of her mistress. Mademoiselle
de Varandeuil knew the whole story. She knew that
she had taken charge of her niece, although she had
pretended not to know it; she had chosen to see nothing
in order to permit everything. She advised Germinie
to entrust her niece to her sister, pointing out to her all
the difficulties in the way of keeping her herself, and she
gave her money to pay for the journey of the whole
family.</p>

<p>The parting was a heart-breaking thing to Germinie.
She found herself left alone and without occupation.
Not having the child, she knew not what to love; her
heart was weary, and she had such a feeling of the emptiness
of life without the little one, that she turned once
more to religion and transferred her affections to the
church.</p>

<p>Three months had passed when she received news of
her sister's death. The husband, who was one of the
whining, lachrymose breed of mechanics, gave her in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
his letter, mingled with labored, moving phrases, and
threads of pathos, a despairing picture of his position,
with the burial to pay for, attacks of fever that prevented
him from working, two young children, without counting
the little girl, and a household with no wife to heat
the soup. Germinie wept over the letter; then her
thoughts turned to living in that house, beside that poor
man, among the poor children, in that horrible Africa;
and a vague longing to sacrifice herself began to awaken
within her. Other letters followed, in which, while
thanking her for her assistance, her brother-in-law gave
to his poverty, to his desolate plight, to the misery that
enveloped him, a still more dramatic coloring&mdash;the coloring
that the common people impart to trifles, with its
memories of the Boulevard du Crime and its fragments
of vile books. Once caught by the <i>blague</i> of this misery,
Germinie could not cut loose from it. She fancied she
could hear the cries of the children calling her. She
became completely absorbed, buried in the project and
resolution of going to them. She was haunted by the
idea and by the word Africa, which she turned over and
over incessantly in the depths of her mind, without
a word. Mademoiselle de Varandeuil, noticing her
thoughtfulness and melancholy, asked her what the
matter was, but in vain: Germinie did not speak. She
was pulled this way and that, tormented between what
seemed to her a duty and what seemed to her ingratitude,
between her mistress and her sisters' blood.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
She thought that she could not leave mademoiselle.
And again she said to herself that God did not
wish her to abandon her family. She would look
about the apartment and mutter: "And yet I must
go!" Then she would fear that mademoiselle might
be sick when she was not there. Another maid! At
that thought she was seized with jealousy and fancied
that she could already see someone stealing her mistress.
At other moments, when her religious ideas impelled her
to thoughts of self-sacrifice, she was all ready to devote
her existence to this brother-in-law. She determined to
go and live with this man, whom she detested, with
whom she had always been on the worst of terms, who
had almost killed her sister with grief, whom she knew
to be a brutish, drunken sot; and all that she anticipated,
all that she dreaded, the certainty of all she would have
to suffer and her shrinking fear of it, served to exalt and
inflame her imagination, to urge her on to the sacrifice
with the greater impatience and ardor. Often the
whole scheme fell to the ground in an instant: at a
word, at a gesture from mademoiselle, Germinie would
become herself once more, and would fail to recognize
herself. She felt that she was bound to her mistress
absolutely and forever, and she had a thrill of horror
at having so much as thought of detaching her own life
from hers. She struggled thus for two years. Then
she learned one fine day, by chance, that her niece had
died a few weeks after her sister: her brother-in-law had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
concealed the child's death in order to maintain his
hold upon her, and to lure her to him in Africa, with her
few sous. Germinie's illusions being wholly dispelled
by that revelation, she was cured on the spot. She
hardly remembered that she had ever thought of going
away.</p>



<hr />
<h2 class="chapter">VII</h2>


<p>About this time a small creamery at the end of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
street, with few customers, changed hands, as a result of
the sale of the real estate by order of court. The shop
was renovated and repainted. The front windows were
embellished with inscriptions in yellow letters. Pyramids
of chocolate from the Compagnie Coloniale, and
coffee-cups filled with flowers, alternating with small
liqueur glasses, were displayed upon the shelves. At
the door glistened the sign&mdash;a copper milk jug divided
in the middle.</p>

<p>The woman who thus endeavored to re-establish the concern,
the new <i>crémière</i>, was a person of about fifty years
of age, whose corpulence passed all bounds, and who still
retained some <i>débris</i> of beauty, half submerged in fat.
It was said in the quarter that she had set herself up in
business with the money of an old gentleman, whose
servant she had been until his death, in her native province,
near Langres; for it happened that she was a
countrywoman of Germinie, not from the same village,
but from a small place near by; and although she and
mademoiselle's maid had never met nor seen each other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
in the country, they knew each other by name and were
drawn together by the fact that they had acquaintances
in common and could compare memories of the same
places. The stout woman was a flattering, affected,
fawning creature. She said: "My love" to everybody,
talked in a piping voice, and played the child with the
querulous languor of corpulent persons. She detested
vulgar remarks and would blush and take alarm at trifles.
She adored secrets, twisted everything into a confidential
communication, invented stories and always whispered
in your ear. Her life was passed in gossiping and groaning.
She pitied others and she pitied herself; she
lamented her ill fortune and her stomach. When she
had eaten too much she would say dramatically: "I am
dying!" and nothing ever was so pathetic as her indigestion.
She was constantly moved to tears: she wept
indiscriminately for a maltreated horse, for someone who
had died, for milk that had curdled. She wept over the
various items in the newspapers, she wept for the sake of
weeping.</p>

<p>Germinie was very soon ensnared and moved to pity
by this wheedling, talkative <i>crémière</i>, who was always in
a state of intense emotion, calling upon others to open
their hearts to her, and apparently so affectionate.
After three months hardly anything passed mademoiselle's
doors that did not come from Mère Jupillon.
Germinie procured everything, or almost everything
there. She passed hours in the shop. Once there it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
was hard work for her to leave; she remained there,
unable to rise from her chair. A sort of instinctive
cowardice detained her. At the door she would stop
and talk on, in order to delay her departure. She felt
bound to the <i>crémière</i> by the invisible charm of familiar
places to which you constantly return, and which end
by embracing you like things that would love you.
And then, too, in her eyes the shop meant Madame
Jupillon's three dogs, three wretched curs; she always
had them on her knees, she scolded them and kissed
them and talked to them; and when she was warm with
their warmth, she would feel in the depths of her heart
the contentment of a beast rubbing against her little
ones. Again, the shop to her meant all the gossip of
the quarter, the rendezvous of all the scandals,&mdash;how
this one had failed to pay her note and that one had
received a carriage load of flowers; it meant a place
that was on the watch for everything, even to the lace
<i>peignoir</i> going to town on the maid's arm.</p>

<p>In a word everything tended to attach her to the
place. Her intimacy with the <i>crémière</i> was strengthened
by all the mysterious bonds of friendship between women
of the people, by the continual chatter, the daily exchange
of the trivial affairs of life, the conversation for
the sake of conversing, the repetition of the same <i>bonjour</i>
and the same <i>bonsoir</i>, the division of caresses among the
same animals, the naps side by side and chair against
chair. The shop at last became her regular place for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
idling away her time, a place where her thoughts, her
words, her body and her very limbs were marvelously at
ease. There came a time when her happiness consisted
in sitting drowsily of an evening in a straw arm-chair,
beside Mère Jupillon&mdash;sound asleep with her spectacles
on her nose&mdash;and holding the dogs rolled in a ball in
the skirt of her dress; and while the lamp, almost
dying, burned pale upon the counter, she would sit idly
there, letting her glance lose itself at the back of the
shop, and gradually grow dim, with her ideas, as her
eyes rested vaguely upon a triumphal arch of snail
shells joined together with old moss, beneath which
stood a little copper Napoléon, with his hands behind
his back.</p>



<hr />
<h2 class="chapter">VIII</h2>


<p>Madame Jupillon, who claimed to have been married<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
and signed herself <i>Widow Jupillon</i>, had a son. He was
still a child. She had placed him at Saint-Nicholas, the
great religious establishment where, for thirty francs a
month, rudimentary instruction and a trade are furnished
to the children of the common people, and to many
natural children. Germinie fell into the way of accompanying
Madame Jupillon when she went to see <i>Bibi</i> on
Thursdays. This visit became a means of distraction to
her, something to look forward to. She would urge the
mother to hurry, would always arrive first at the omnibus
office, and was content to sit with her arms resting on a
huge basket of provisions all the way.</p>

<p>It happened that Mère Jupillon had trouble with her
leg&mdash;a carbuncle that prevented her from walking for
nearly eighteen months. Germinie went alone to Saint-Nicholas,
and as she was promptly and easily led to
devote herself to others, she took as deep an interest in
that child as if he were connected with her in some
way. She did not miss a single Thursday and always
arrived with her hands full of the last week's desserts,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
and with cakes and fruit and sweetmeats she had bought.
She would kiss the urchin, inquire for his health, and
feel to see if he had his knitted vest under his blouse;
she would notice how flushed he was from running,
would wipe his face with her handkerchief and make
him show her the soles of his shoes so that she could
see if there were any holes in them. She would ask if
his teachers were satisfied with him, if he attended to
his duties and if he had had many good marks. She
would talk to him of his mother and bid him love the
good Lord, and until the clock struck two she would
walk with him in the courtyard: the child would offer
her his arm, as proud as you please to be with a woman
much better dressed than the majority of those who
came there&mdash;with a woman in silk. He was anxious to
learn the flageolet. It cost only five francs a month,
but his mother would not give them. Germinie carried
him the hundred sous every month, on the sly. It was
a humiliating thing to him to wear the little uniform
blouse when he went out to walk, and on the two or
three occasions during the year when he went to see his
mother. On his birthday, one year, Germinie unfolded
a large parcel before him: she had had a tunic made for
him; it is doubtful if twenty of his comrades in the
whole school belonged to families in sufficiently easy
circumstances to wear such garments.</p>

<p>She spoiled him thus for several years, not allowing
him to suffer with a longing for anything, encouraging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
the caprices and the pride of wealthy children in the poor
child, softening for him the privations and hardships of
that trade school, where children were formed for a
laboring life, wore blouses and ate off plates of brown
earthenware; a school that by its toilsome apprenticeship
hardened the children of the people to lives of toil.
Meanwhile the boy was growing fast. Germinie did
not notice it: in her eyes he was still the child he had
always been. From habit she always stooped to kiss
him. One day she was summoned before the abbé who
was at the head of the school. He spoke to her of
expelling Jupillon. Obscene books had been found in
his possession. Germinie, trembling at the thought
of the blows that awaited the child at his mother's
hands, prayed and begged and implored; she succeeded
at last in inducing the abbé to forgive the culprit. When
she went down into the courtyard again she attempted
to scold him; but at the first word of her moral lecture,
Bibi suddenly cast in her face a glance and smile in
which there was no trace of the child that he was the
day before. She lowered her eyes, and she was the one
to blush. A fortnight passed before she went again to
Saint-Nicholas.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>




<hr />
<h2 class="chapter">IX</h2>


<p>About the time that young Jupillon left the boarding-school,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
a maid in the service of a kept woman who lived
on the floor below mademoiselle sometimes passed the
evening with Germinie at Madame Jupillon's. A native
of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, which supplies
Paris with coupé drivers and lorettes' waiting-maids,
this girl was what is called in vulgar parlance: "a great
<i>bringue</i>;" she was an awkward, wild-eyed creature, with
the eyebrows of a water carrier. She soon fell into the
habit of going there every evening. She treated everybody
to cakes and liquors, amused herself by showing
off little Jupillon, playing pat-a-cake with him, sitting
on his knee, telling him to his face that he was a beauty,
treating him like a child, playing the wanton with him
and joking him because he was not a man. The boy,
happy and proud of these attentions from the first woman
who had ever taken notice of him, manifested before long
his preference for Adèle: so was the new-comer called.</p>

<p>Germinie was passionately jealous. Jealousy was the
foundation of her nature; it was the dregs of her affection
and gave it its bitter taste. Those whom she loved<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
she wished to have entirely to herself, to possess them
absolutely. She demanded that they should love no one
but her. She could not permit them to take from her
and bestow upon others the slightest fragment of their
affection: as she had earned it, it no longer belonged
to them; they were no longer entitled to dispose of it.
She detested the people whom her mistress seemed to
welcome more cordially than others, and with whom she
was on most intimate terms. By her ill-humor and her
sullen manner she had offended, had almost driven from
the house, two or three of mademoiselle's old friends,
whose visits wounded her; as if the old ladies came
there for the purpose of abstracting something from the
rooms, of taking a little of her mistress from her.
People of whom she had once been fond became
odious to her: she did not consider that they were fond
enough of her; she hated them for all the love she
wanted from them. Her heart was despotic and exacting
in everything. As it gave all, it demanded all in
return. At the least sign of coldness, at the slightest
indication that she had a rival, she would fly into a rage,
tear her hair, pass her nights in weeping, and execrate
the whole world.</p>

<p>Seeing that other woman make herself at home in the
shop and adopt a tone of familiarity with the young man,
all Germinie's jealous instincts were aroused and changed
to furious rage. Her hatred flew to arms and rebelled,
with her disgust, against the shameless, brazen-faced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
creature, who could be seen on Sunday sitting at table
on the outer boulevards with soldiers, and who had blue
marks on her face on Monday. She did her utmost to
induce Madame Jupillon to turn her away; but she was
one of the best customers of the creamery, and the
<i>crémière</i> mildly refused to close her doors upon her.
Germinie had recourse to the son and told him that she
was a miserable creature. But that only served to
attach the young man the closer to the vile woman,
whose evil reputation delighted him. Moreover, he
had the cruel mischievous instinct of youth, and he
redoubled his attentions to her simply to see "the nose"
that Germinie made and to enjoy her despair. Soon
Germinie discovered that the woman's intentions were
more serious than she had at first supposed: she began
to understand what she wanted of the child,&mdash;for the tall
youth of seventeen was still a child in her eyes. Thenceforward
she hung upon their steps; she was always beside
them, never left them alone for a moment, made one at
all their parties, at the theatre or in the country, joined
them in all their walks, was always at hand and in the
way, seeking to hold Adèle back, and to restore her
sense of decency by a word in an undertone: "A mere
boy! ain't you ashamed?" she would say to her. And
the other would laugh aloud, as if it were a good joke.</p>

<p>When they left the theatre, enlivened and heated by
the feverish excitement of the performance and the
place; when they returned from an excursion to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
country, laden with a long day's sunshine, intoxicated
with the blue sky and the pure air, excited by the wine
imbibed at dinner, amid the sportive liberties in which
the woman of the people, drunk with enjoyment and
with the delights of unlimited good cheer, and with the
senses keyed up to the highest pitch of joviality, makes
bold to indulge at night, Germinie tried to be always
between the maid and Jupillon. She never relaxed her
efforts to break the lovers' hold upon each other's arms,
to unbind them, to uncouple them. Never wearying of
the task, she was forever separating them, luring them
away from each other. She placed her body between
those bodies that were groping for each other. She
glided between the hands outstretched to touch each
other; she glided between the lips that were put forth in
search of other proffered lips. But of all this that she
prevented she felt the breath and the shock. She felt
the pressure of the hands she held apart, the caresses
that she caught on the wing and that missed their mark
and went astray upon her. The hot breath of the kisses
she intercepted blew upon her cheek. Involuntarily,
and with a feeling of horror, she became a party to the
embracing, she was infected with the desires aroused by
this constant friction and struggling, which diminished
day by day the young man's restraint and respect for her
person.</p>

<p>It happened one day that she was less strong against
herself than she had previously been. On that occasion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
she did not elude his advances so abruptly as usual.
Jupillon felt that she stopped short. Germinie felt it
even more keenly than he; but she was at the end of
her efforts, exhausted with the torture she had undergone.
The love which, coming from another, she had
turned aside from Jupillon, had slowly taken full possession
of her own heart. Now it was firmly rooted there,
and, bleeding with jealousy, she found that she was
incapable of resistance, weak and fainting, like a person
fatally wounded, in presence of the joy that had come
to her.</p>

<p>She repelled the young man's audacious attempts,
however, without a word. She did not dream of belonging
to him otherwise than as a friend, or giving way
farther than she had done. She lived upon the thought
of love, believing that she could live upon it always.
And in the ecstatic exaltation of her thoughts, she put
aside all memory of her fall, and repressed her desires.
She remained shuddering and pure, lost and suspended
in abysses of affection, neither enjoying nor wishing for
aught from the lover but a caress, as if her heart were
made only for the joy of kissing.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>




<hr />
<h2 class="chapter">X</h2>


<p>This happy though unsatisfied love produced a strange<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
physiological phenomenon in Germinie's physical being.
One would have said that the passion that was alive
within her renewed and transformed her lymphatic temperament.
She did not seem, as before, to extract her
life, drop by drop, from a penurious spring: it flowed
through her arteries in a full, generous stream; she felt
the tingling sensation of rich blood over her whole
body. She seemed to be filled with the warm glow of
health, and the joy of living beat its wings in her breast
like a bird in the sunlight.</p>

<p>A marvelous animation had come to her. The miserable
nervous energy that once sustained her had given
place to healthy activity, to bustling, restless, overflowing
gayety. She had no trace now of the weakness, the
dejection, the prostration, the supineness, the sluggishness
that formerly distinguished her. The heavy, drowsy
feeling in the morning was a thing of the past; she
awoke feeling fresh and bright, and alive in an instant
to the cheer of the new day. She dressed in haste,
playfully; her agile fingers moved of themselves, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
she was amazed to be so bright and full of activity during
the hours of faintness before breakfast, when she
had so often felt her heart upon her lips. And throughout
the day she had the same consciousness of physical
well-being, the same briskness of movement. She
must be always on the move, walking, running, doing
something, expending her strength. At times all that
she had lived through seemed to have no existence; the
sensations of living that she had hitherto experienced
seemed to her like a far-off dream, or as if dimly seen
in the background of a sleeping memory. The past
lay behind her, as if she had traversed it, covered with
a veil like one in a swoon, or with the unconsciousness
of a somnambulist. It was the first time that she had
experienced the feeling, the impression, at once bitter
and sweet, violent and celestial, of the game of life
brilliant in its plenitude, its regularity and its power.</p>

<p>She ran up and downstairs for a nothing. At a word
from mademoiselle she would trip down the whole five
flights. When she was seated, her feet danced on the
floor. She brushed and scrubbed and beat and shook
and washed and set to rights, without rest or reprieve,
always at work, filling the apartment with her goings
and comings, and the incessant bustle that followed her
about.&mdash;"Mon Dieu!" her mistress would say, stunned
by the uproar she made, just like a child,&mdash;"you're
turning things upside down, Germinie! that will do for
that!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>One day, when she went into Germinie's kitchen,
mademoiselle saw a little earth in a cigar box on the
leads.&mdash;"What's that?" she asked.&mdash;"That's grass&mdash;that
I planted&mdash;to look at," said Germinie.&mdash;"So
you're in love with grass now, eh? All you need now
is to have canaries!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>




<hr />
<h2 class="chapter">XI</h2>


<p>In the course of a few months, Germinie's life, her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
whole life belonged to the <i>crémière</i>. Mademoiselle's service
was not exacting and took but little time. A whiting
or a cutlet&mdash;that was all the cooking there was to be
done. Mademoiselle might have kept her with her in the
evening for company: she preferred, however, to send
her away, to drive her out of doors, to force her to take a
little air and diversion. She asked only that she would
return at ten o'clock to help her to bed; and yet when
Germinie was a little late, mademoiselle undressed
herself and went to bed alone very comfortably. Every
hour that her mistress left her at leisure, Germinie
passed in the shop. She fell into the habit of going
down to the creamery in the morning, when the shutters
were removed, and generally carried them inside;
she would take her <i>café au lait</i> there and remain until
nine o'clock, when she would go back and give mademoiselle
her chocolate; and between breakfast and
dinner she found excuses for returning two or three
times, delaying and chattering in the back-shop on the
slightest pretext. "What a magpie you are getting to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
be!" mademoiselle would say, in a scolding voice, but
with a smiling face.</p>

<p>At half past five, when her mistress's little dinner was
cleared away, she would run down the stairs four at a
time, install herself at Mère Jupillon's, wait until ten
o'clock, clamber up the five flights, and in five minutes
undress her mistress, who submitted unresistingly,
albeit she was somewhat astonished that Germinie
should be in such haste to go to bed; she remembered
the time when she had a mania for moving her sleepy
body from one easy-chair to another, and was never
willing to go up to her room. While the candle was
still smoking on mademoiselle's night table, Germinie
would be back at the creamery, this time to remain
until midnight, until one o'clock; often she did not go
until a policeman, noticing the light, tapped on the
shutters and made them close up.</p>

<p>In order to be always there and to have the right to
be always there, to make herself a part of the shop, to
keep her eyes constantly upon the man she loved, to
hover about him, to keep him, to be always brushing
against him, she had become the servant of the establishment.
She swept the shop, she prepared the old
woman's meals and the food for the dogs. She waited
upon the son; she made his bed, she brushed his
clothes, she waxed his boots, happy and proud to touch
what he touched, thrilling with pleasure when she placed
her hand where he placed his body, and ready to kiss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
the mud upon the leather of his boots, because it was
his!</p>

<p>She did the menial work, she kept the shop, she
served the customers. Madame Jupillon rested everything
upon her shoulders; and while the good-natured
girl was working and perspiring, the bulky matron,
assuming the majestic, leisurely air of an annuitant,
anchored upon a chair in the middle of the sidewalk
and inhaling the fresh air of the street, fingered and
rattled the precious coin in the capacious pocket beneath
her apron&mdash;the coin that rings so sweetly in the ears of
the petty tradesmen of Paris, that the retired shopkeeper
is melancholy beyond words at first, because he
no longer has the chinking and the tinkling under his
hand.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span></p>




<hr />
<h2 class="chapter">XII</h2>


<p>When the spring came, Germinie said to Jupillon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
almost every evening: "Suppose we go as far as the
beginning of the fields?"</p>

<p>Jupillon would put on his flannel shirt with red and
black squares, and his black velvet cap; and they would
start for what the people of the quarter call "the beginning
of the fields."</p>

<p>They would go up the Chaussée Clignancourt, and,
with the flood of Parisians from the faubourg hurrying
to drink a little fresh air, would walk on toward the
great patch of sky that rose straight from the pavements,
at the top of the ascent, between the two lines of houses,
unobstructed except by an occasional omnibus. The
air was growing cooler and the sun shone only upon the
roofs of the houses and the chimneys. As from a great
door opening into the country, there came from the
end of the street and from the sky beyond, a breath
of boundless space and liberty.</p>

<p>At the Château-Rouge they found the first tree, the
first foliage. Then, at Rue du Château, the horizon
opened before them in dazzling beauty. The fields<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
stretched away in the distance, glistening vaguely in
the powdery, golden haze of seven o'clock. All nature
trembled in the daylight dust that the day leaves in its
wake, upon the verdure it blots from sight and the
houses it suffuses with pink.</p>

<p>Frequently they descended the footpath covered with
the figures of the game of hop-scotch marked out in
charcoal, by long walls with an occasional overhanging
branch, by lines of detached houses with gardens
between. At their left rose tree-tops filled with light,
clustering foliage pierced by the beams of the setting
sun, which cast lines of fire across the bars of the iron
gateways. After the gardens came hedgerows, estates
for sale, unfinished buildings erected upon the line
of projected streets and stretching out their jagged
walls into empty space, with heaps of broken bottles at
their feet; large, low, plastered houses, with windows
filled with bird-cages and cloths, and with the
Y of the sink-pipes at every floor; and openings into
enclosures that resembled barnyards, studded with little
mounds on which goats were browsing.</p>

<p>They would stop here and there and smell the flowers,
inhale the perfume of a meagre lilac growing in a narrow
lane. Germinie would pluck a leaf in passing and
nibble at it.</p>

<p>Flocks of joyous swallows flew wildly about in circles
and in fantastic figures over her head. The birds called.
The sky answered the cages. She heard everything
about her singing, and glanced with a glad eye at the
women in chemisettes at the windows, the men in their
shirt sleeves in the little gardens, the mothers on the
doorsteps with their little ones between their legs.</p>

But at the fortifications her pleasure returned. She
would go with Jupillon and sit upon the slope of the
embankment. Beside her were families innumerable,
workmen lying flat upon their faces, small annuitants

of want, bent double, with their hands upon their knees,
the greasy coats characteristic of old men, and black
hats worn as red as their red beards." title="" /></div>

</div>
<div class="minispace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>At the foot of the slope the pavement came to an end.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
The street was succeeded by a broad, white, chalky,
dusty road, made of débris, old pieces of plaster, crumbs
of lime and bricks; a sunken road, with deep ruts,
polished on the edges, made by the iron tires of the
huge great wheels of carts laden with hewn stone. At
that point began the things that collect where Paris ends,
the things that grow where grass does not grow, one of
those arid landscapes that large cities create around
them, the first zone of suburbs <i>intra muros</i> where nature
is exhausted, the soil used up, the fields sown with
oyster shells. Beyond was a wilderness of half-enclosed
yards displaying numbers of carts and trucks with their
shafts in the air against the sky, stone-cutters' sheds,
factories built of boards, unfinished workmen's houses,
full of gaps and open to the light, and bearing the
mason's flag, wastes of gray and white sand, kitchen
gardens marked out with cords, and, on the lower level,
bogs to which the embankment of the road slopes down
in oceans of small stones.</p>

<p>Soon they would reach the last lantern hanging on a
green post. People were still coming and going about
them. The road was alive and amused the eyes. They
met women carrying their husband's canes, lorettes in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
silk dresses leaning on the arms of their blouse-clad
brothers, old women in bright-colored ginghams walking
about with folded arms, enjoying a moment's rest
from labor. Workmen were drawing their children
in little wagons, urchins returning with their rods from
fishing at Saint-Ouen, and men and women dragging
branches of flowering acacia at the ends of sticks.</p>

<p>Sometimes a pregnant woman would pass, holding out
her arms to a yet small child, and casting the shadow of
her pregnancy upon the wall.</p>

<p>And everyone moved tranquilly, blissfully, at a pace
that told of the wish to delay, with the awkward ease
and the happy indolence of those who walk for pleasure.
No one was in a hurry, and against the unbroken horizon
line, crossed from time to time by the white smoke of a
railroad train, the groups of promenaders were like black
spots, almost motionless, in the distance.</p>

<p>Behind Montmartre, they came to those great moats,
as it were, those sloping squares, where narrow, gray,
much-trodden paths cross and recross. A few blades of
shriveled, yellow grass grew thereabout, softened by the
rays of the setting sun, which they could see, all ablaze,
between the houses. And Germinie loved to watch the
wool-combers at work there, the quarry horses at pasture
in the bare fields, the madder-red trousers of the soldiers
who were playing at bowls, the children flying kites that
made black spots in the clear air. Passing all these, they
turned to cross the bridge over the railroad by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
wretched settlement of ragpickers, the stonemasons'
quarter at the foot of Clignancourt hill. They would
walk quickly by those houses built of materials stolen
from demolished buildings, and exuding the horrors they
conceal; the wretched structures, half cabin, half burrow,
caused Germinie a vague feeling of terror: it seemed to
her as if all the crimes of Night were lurking there.</p>

<p>But at the fortifications her pleasure returned. She
would go with Jupillon and sit upon the slope of the
embankment. Beside her were families innumerable,
workmen lying flat upon their faces, small annuitants
gazing at the horizon through spy-glasses, philosophers
of want, bent double, with their hands upon their knees,
the greasy coats characteristic of old men, and black
hats worn as red as their red beards. The air was full
of rich harmonies. Below her, in the moat, a musical
society was playing at each corner. Before her eyes was
a multi-colored crowd, white blouses, children in blue
aprons running around, a game of riding at the ring in
progress, wine shops, cake shops, fried fish stalls, and
shooting galleries half hidden in clumps of verdure,
from which arose staves bearing the tricolor; and farther
away, in a bluish haze, a line of tree tops marked
the location of a road. To the right she could see
Saint-Denis and the towering basilica; at her left, above
a line of houses that were becoming indistinct, the sun
was setting over Saint-Ouen in a disk of cherry-colored
flame, and projecting upon the gray horizon shafts of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
light like red pillars that seemed to support it tremblingly.
Often a child's balloon would pass swiftly
across the dazzling expanse of sky.</p>

<p>They would go down, pass through the gate, walk
along by the Lorraine sausage shops, the dealers in
honeycomb, the board <i>cabarets</i>, the verdureless, still
unpainted arbors, where a noisy multitude of men and
women and children were eating fried potatoes, mussels
and prawns, until they reached the first field, the first
living grass: on the edge of the grass there was a handcart
laden with gingerbread and peppermint lozenges,
and a woman selling hot cocoa on a table in the furrow.
A strange country, where everything was mingled&mdash;the
smoke from the frying-pan and the evening vapor,
the noise of quoits on the head of a cask and the
silence shed from the sky, the city barrier and the
idyllic rural scene, the odor of manure and the fresh
smell of green wheat, the great human Fair and Nature!
Germinie enjoyed it, however; and, urging Jupillon to
go farther, walking on the very edge of the road, she
would constantly step in among the grain to enjoy the
fresh, cool sensation of the stalks against her stockings.
When they returned she always wanted to go upon the
slope once more. The sun had by that time disappeared
and the sky was gray below, pink in the centre and
blue above. The horizon grew dark; from green the
trees became a dark brown and melted into the sky; the
zinc roofs of the wine shops looked as if the moon were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
shining upon them, fires began to appear in the darkness,
the crowd became gray, and the white linen took
on a bluish tinge. Little by little everything would
fade away, be blotted out, lose its form and color in a
dying remnant of colorless daylight, and through the
increasing darkness the voices of a class whose life
begins at night, and the voice of the wine beginning to
sing, would arise, mingled with the din of the rattles.
Upon the slope the tops of the tall grass waved to and
fro in the gentle breeze. Germinie would make up her
mind to go. She would wend her way homeward, filled
with the influence of the falling night, abandoning herself
to the uncertain vision of things half-seen, passing
the dark houses, and finding that everything along her
road had turned paler, as it were&mdash;wearied by the long
walk over rough roads, and content to be weary and
slow and half-fainting, and with a feeling of peace at
her heart.</p>

<p>At the first lighted lanterns on Rue du Château, she
would fall from her dream to the pavement.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>




<hr />
<h2 class="chapter">XIII</h2>


<p>Madame Jupillon's face always wore a pleased expression<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
when Germinie appeared; when she kissed her she
was very effusive, when she spoke to her her voice was
caressing, when she looked at her her glance was most
amiable. The huge creature's kind heart seemed, when
with her, to abandon itself to the emotion, the affection,
the trustfulness of a sort of maternal tenderness.
She took Germinie into her confidence as to her business,
as to her woman's secrets, as to the most private
affairs of her life. She seemed to open her heart to her
as to a person of her own blood, whom she desired to
make familiar with matters of interest to the family.
When she spoke of the future, she always referred to
Germinie as one from whom she was never to be separated,
and who formed a part of the household. Often
she allowed certain discreet, mysterious smiles to escape
her, smiles which made it appear that she saw all that
was going on and was not angry. Sometimes, too,
when her son was sitting by Germinie's side, she would
let her eyes, moist with a mother's tears, rest upon them,
and would embrace them with a glance that seemed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
unite her two children and call down a blessing on their
heads.</p>

<p>Without speaking, without ever uttering a word that
could be construed as an engagement, without divulging
her thoughts or binding herself in any way, and all the
time repeating that her son was still very young to think
of being married, she encouraged Germinie's hopes and
illusions by her whole bearing, her airs of secret indulgence
and of complicity, so far as her heart was concerned;
by those meaning silences when she seemed to
open to her a mother-in-law's arms. And displaying all
her talents in the way of hypocrisy, drawing upon her
hidden mines of sentiment, her good-natured shrewdness,
and the consummate, intricate cunning that fat
people possess, the corpulent matron succeeded in vanquishing
Germinie's last resistance by dint of this tacit
assurance and promise of marriage; and she finally
allowed the young man's ardor to extort from her what
she believed that she was giving in advance to the
husband.</p>



<hr />
<h2 class="chapter">XIV</h2>


<p>As Germinie was going down the servant's staircase<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
one day, she heard Adèle's voice calling her over the
banister and telling her to bring her two sous' worth of
butter and ten of absinthe.</p>

<p>"Oh! you can sit down a minute, you know you
can," said Adèle, when she brought her the absinthe
and the butter. "I never see you now, you'll never
come in. Come! you have plenty of time to be with
your old woman. For my part, I couldn't live with an
Antichrist's face like hers! So stay. This is the house
without work to-day. There isn't a sou&mdash;madame's
abed. Whenever there's no money, she goes to bed,
does madame; she stays in bed all day, reading novels.
Have some of this?"&mdash;And she offered her her glass of
absinthe.&mdash;"No? oh! no, you don't drink. You're
very foolish. It's a funny thing not to drink. Say, it
would be very nice of you to write me a little line for
my dearie. Hard work, you know. I have told you
about it. See, here's madame's pen&mdash;and her paper&mdash;it
smells good. Are you ready? He's a good fellow,
my dear, and no mistake! He's in the butcher line as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
I told you. Ah! my word! I mustn't rub him the
wrong way! When he's had a glass of blood after killing
his beasts, he's like a madman&mdash;and if you're
obstinate with him&mdash;Dame! why then he thumps you!
But what would you have? He does that to make him
strong. If you could see him thump himself on the
breast&mdash;blows that would kill an ox, and say: 'That's
a wall, that is!' Ah! he's a gentleman, I tell you!
Are you thinking about the letter, eh? Make it one of
the fetching kind. Say nice things to him, you know&mdash;and
a little sad&mdash;he adores that. At the theatre he
doesn't like anything that doesn't make him cry. Look
here! Imagine that you're writing to a lover of your
own."</p>

<p>Germinie began to write.</p>

<p>"Say, Germinie! Have you heard? Madame's
taken a strange idea into her head. It's a funny thing
about women like her, who can hold their heads up with
the greatest of 'em, who can have everything, hobnob
with kings if they choose! And there's nothing to be
said&mdash;when one is like madame, you know, when one
has such a body as that! And then the way they load
themselves down with finery, with their tralala of dresses
and lace everywhere and everything else&mdash;how do you
suppose anyone can resist them? And if it isn't a gentleman,
if it's someone like us&mdash;you can see how much
more all that will catch him; a woman in velvet goes
to his brain. Yes, my dear, just fancy, here's madame<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
gone daft on that <i>gamin</i> of a Jupillon! That's all we
needed to make us die of hunger here!"</p>

<p>Germinie, with her pen in the air over the letter she
had begun, looked up at Adèle, devouring her with her
eyes.</p>

<p>"That brings you to a standstill, doesn't it?" said
Adèle, sipping her absinthe, her face lighted up with joy
at sight of Germinie's discomposed features. "Oh! it is
too absurd, really; but it's true, 'pon my word it's true.
She noticed the <i>gamin</i> on the steps of the shop the other
day, coming home from the races. She's been there
two or three times on the pretence of buying something.
She'll probably have some perfumery sent from there&mdash;to-morrow,
I think.&mdash;Bah! it's sickening, isn't it? It's
their affair. Well! what about my letter? Is it what
I told you that makes you so stupid? You played the
prude&mdash;I didn't know&mdash;Oh! yes, yes, now I remember;
that's what it is&mdash;What was it you said to me about the
little one? I believe you didn't want anyone to touch
him! Idiot!"</p>

<p>At a gesture of denial from Germinie, she continued:</p>

<p>"Nonsense, nonsense! What do I care? The kind
of a child that, if you blew his nose, milk would come
out! Thanks! that's not my style. However, that's
your business. Come, now for my letter, eh?"</p>

<p>Germinie leaned over the sheet of paper. But she
was burning up with fever; the quill cracked in her
nervous fingers. "There," she said, throwing it down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
after a few seconds, "I don't know what's the matter
with me to-day. I'll write it for you another time."</p>

<p>"As you like, little one&mdash;but I rely on you. Come
to-morrow, then.&mdash;I'll tell you some of madame's nonsense.
We'll have a good laugh at her!"</p>

<p>And, when the door was closed, Adèle began to roar
with laughter: it had cost her only a little <i>blague</i> to
unearth Germinie's secret.</p>



<hr />
<h2 class="chapter">XV</h2>


<p>So far as young Jupillon was concerned, love was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
simply the satisfaction of a certain evil curiosity, which
sought, in the knowledge and possession of a woman,
the privilege and the pleasure of despising her. Just
emerging from boyhood, the young man had brought
to his first <i>liaison</i> no other ardor, no other flame than
the cold instincts of rascality awakened in boys by vile
books, the confidences of their comrades, boarding-school
conversation, the first breath of impurity which
debauches desire. The sentiment with which the young
man usually regards the woman who yields to him, the
caresses, the loving words, the affectionate attentions
with which he envelops her&mdash;nothing of all that existed
in Jupillon's case. Woman was to him simply an
obscene image; and a passion for a woman seemed to
him desirable as being prohibited, illicit, vulgar, cynical
and amusing&mdash;an excellent opportunity for trickery and
sarcasm.</p>

<p>Sarcasm&mdash;the low, cowardly, despicable sarcasm of
the dregs of the people&mdash;was the beginning and the end
of this youth. He was a perfect type of those Parisians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
who bear upon their faces the mocking scepticism of
the great city of <i>blague</i> in which they are born. The
smile, the shrewdness and the mischief of the Parisian
physiognomy were always mocking and impertinent in
him. Jupillon's smile had the jovial expression imparted
by a wicked mouth, a mouth that was almost
cruel at the corners of the lips, which curled upward
and were always twitching nervously. His face was
pale with the pallor that nitric acid strong enough to eat
copper gives to the complexion, and in his sharp, pert,
bold features were mingled bravado, energy, recklessness,
intelligence, impudence and all sorts of rascally
expressions, softened, at certain times, by a cat-like,
wheedling air. His trade of glove-cutter&mdash;he had taken
up with that trade after two or three unsuccessful trials
as an apprentice in other crafts&mdash;the habit of working
in the shop-windows, of being on exhibition to the
passers-by, had given to his whole person the self-assurance
and the dandified airs of a <i>poseur</i>. Sitting in the
work-shop on the street, with his white shirt, his little
black cravat <i>à la Colin</i>, and his skin-tight pantaloons,
he had adopted an awkward air of nonchalance, the
pretentious carriage and <i>canaille</i> affectations of the
workman who knows he is being stared at. And various
little refinements of doubtful taste, the parting of the
hair in the middle and brushing it down over the temples,
the low shirt collars that left the whole neck bare,
the striving after the coquettish effects that properly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
belong to the other sex, gave him an uncertain appearance,
which was made even more ambiguous by his
beardless face, marred only by a faint suggestion of a
moustache, and his sexless features to which passion and
ill-temper imparted all the evil quality of a shrewish
woman's face. But in Germinie's eyes all these airs
and this Jupillon style were of the highest distinction.</p>

<p>Thus constituted, with nothing lovable about him and
incapable of a genuine attachment even through his
passions, Jupillon was greatly embarrassed and bored
by this adoration which became intoxicated with itself,
and waxed greater day by day. Germinie wearied him
to death. She seemed to him absurd in her humiliation,
and laughable in her devotion. He was weary,
disgusted, worn out with her. He had had enough of her
love, enough of her person. And he had no hesitation
about cutting loose from her, without charity or pity.
He ran away from her. He failed to keep the appointments
she made. He pretended that he was kept away
by accident, by errands to be done, by a pressure of
work. At night, she waited for him and he did not
come; she supposed that he was detained by business:
in fact he was at some low billiard hall, or at some ball
at the barrier.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span></p>




<hr />
<h2 class="chapter">XVI</h2>


<p>There was a ball at the <i>Boule-Noire</i> one Thursday.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
The dancing was in full blast.</p>

<p>The ball-room had the ordinary appearance of modern
places of amusement for the people. It was brilliant
with false richness and tawdry splendor. There were
paintings there, and tables at which wine was sold,
gilded chandeliers and glasses that held a quartern of
brandy, velvet hangings and wooden benches, the
shabbiness and rusticity of an ale-house with the decorations
of a cardboard palace.</p>

<p>Garnet velvet lambrequins with a fringe of gold lace
hung at the windows and were economically copied in
paint beneath the mirrors, which were lighted by three-branched
candelabra. On the walls, in large white
panels, pastoral scenes by Boucher, surrounded with
painted frames, alternated with Prud'hon's <i>Seasons</i>,
which were much astonished to find themselves in such
a place; and above the windows and doors dropsical
Loves gamboled among five roses protruding from a
pomade jar of the sort used by suburban hair-dressers.
Square pillars, embellished with meagre arabesques,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
supported the ceiling in the centre of the hall, where
there was a small octagonal stand containing the orchestra.
An oaken rail, waist high, which served as a back
to a cheap red bench, enclosed the dancers. And against
this rail, on the outside, were tables painted green and
two rows of benches, surrounding the dance with a café.</p>

<p>In the dancers' enclosure, beneath the fierce glare
and the intense heat of the gas, were women of all
sorts, dressed in dark, worn, rumpled woolens, women
in black tulle caps, women in black <i>paletots</i>, women in
<i>caracos</i> worn shiny at the seams, women in fur tippets
bought of open-air dealers and in shops in dark alleys.
And in the whole assemblage not one of the youthful
faces was set off by a collar, not a glimpse of a white
skirt could be seen among the whirling dancers, not a
glimmer of white about these women, who were all
dressed in gloomy colors, the colors of want, to the
ends of their unpolished shoes. This absence of linen
gave to the ball an aspect as of poverty in mourning; it
imparted to all the faces a touch of gloom and uncleanness,
of lifelessness and earthiness&mdash;a vaguely forbidding
aspect, in which there was a suggestion of the Hôtel-Dieu
and the Mont-de-Piété!</p>

<p>An old woman in a wig with the hair parted at the
side passed in front of the tables, with a basket filled
with pieces of Savoy cake and red apples.</p>

<p>From time to time the dance, in its twisting and
turning, disclosed a soiled stocking, the typical Jewish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
features of a street pedlar of sponges, red fingers protruding
from black mitts, a swarthy moustached face, an
under-petticoat soiled with the mud of night before
last, a second-hand-skirt, stiff and crumpled, of flowered
calico, the cast-off finery of some kept mistress.</p>

<p>The men wore <i>paletots</i>, small, soft caps pulled down
over their ears, and woolen comforters untied and hanging
down their backs. They invited the women to
dance by pulling them by the cap ribbons that fluttered
behind them. Some few, in hats and frockcoats and
colored shirts, had an insolent air of domesticity and a
swagger befitting grooms in some great family.</p>

<p>Everybody was jumping and bustling about. The
women frisked and capered and gamboled, excited and
stimulated by the spur of bestial pleasure. And in the
evolutions of the contra-dance, one could hear brothel
addresses given: <i>Impasse du Dépotoir</i>.</p>

<p>Germinie entered the hall just at the conclusion of a
quadrille to the air of <i>La Casquette du père Bugeaud</i>,
in which the cymbals, the sleigh-bells and the drum had
infected the dancers with the giddiness and madness
of their uproar. At a glance she embraced the whole
room, all the men leading their partners back to the
places marked by their caps: she had been misled; <i>he</i>
was not there, she could not see him. However, she
waited. She entered the dancers' enclosure and sat down
on the end of a bench, trying not to seem too much
embarrassed. From their linen caps she judged that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
women seated in line beside her were servants like herself:
comrades of her own class alarmed her less than
the little brazen-faced hussies, with their hair in nets
and their hands in the pockets of their <i>paletots</i>, who
strolled humming about the room. But soon she aroused
hostile attention, even on her bench. Her hat&mdash;only
about a dozen women at the ball wore hats&mdash;her flounced
skirt, the white hem of which could be seen under her
dress, the gold brooch that secured her shawl awakened
malevolent curiosity all about her. Glances and smiles
were bestowed upon her that boded her no good. All
the women seemed to be asking one another where this
new arrival had come from, and to be saying to one
another that she would take their lovers from them.
Young women who were walking about the hall in pairs,
with their arms about one another's waists as if for a
waltz, made her lower her eyes as they passed in front
of her, and then went on with a contemptuous shrug,
turning their heads to look back at her.</p>

<p>She changed her place: she was met with the same
smiles, the same whispering, the same hostility. She
went to the further end of the hall; all the women
looked after her; she felt as if she were enveloped in
malicious, envious glances, from the hem of her dress
to the flowers on her hat. Her face flushed. At times
she feared that she should weep. She longed to leave
the place, but she lacked courage to walk the length of
the hall all alone.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>She began mechanically to watch an old woman who
was slowly making the circuit of the hall with a noiseless
step, like a bird of night flying in a circle. A
black hat, of the hue of charred paper, confined her
<i>bandeaux</i> of grizzled hair. From her square, high masculine
shoulders, hung a sombre-hued Scotch tartan.
When she reached the door, she cast a last glance about
the hall, that embraced everyone therein, with the eye
of a vulture seeking in vain for food.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was an outcry: a police officer was
ejecting a diminutive youth who tried to bite his hands
and clung to the tables, against which, as he was dragged
along, he struck with a noise like breaking furniture.</p>

<p>As Germinie turned her head she spied Jupillon: he
was sitting between two women at a green table in a
window-recess, smoking. One of the two was a tall
blonde with a small quantity of frizzled flaxen hair, a
flat, stupid face and round eyes. A red flannel chemise
lay in folds on her back, and she had both hands in the
pockets of a black apron which she was flapping up
and down on her dark red skirt. The other, a short,
dark creature, whose face was still red from having been
scrubbed with soap, was enveloped as to her head, with
the coquetry of a fishwoman, in a white knitted hood
with a blue border.</p>

<p>Jupillon had recognized Germinie. When he saw
her rise and approach him, with her eyes fixed upon
his face, he whispered something to the woman in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
hood, rested his elbows defiantly on the table and
waited.</p>

<p>"Hallo! you here," he exclaimed when Germinie
stood before him, erect, motionless and mute. "This
is a surprise!&mdash;Waiter! another bowl!"</p>

<p>And, emptying the bowl of sweetened wine into the
two women's glasses, he continued: "Come, don't
make up faces&mdash;sit down there."</p>

<p>And, as Germinie did not budge: "Go on! These
ladies are friends of mine&mdash;ask them!"</p>

<p>"Mélie," said the woman in the hood to the other
woman, in a voice like a diseased crow's, "don't you
see? She's monsieur's mother. Make room for the
lady if she'd like to drink with us."</p>

<p>Germinie cast a murderous glance at the woman.</p>

<p>"Well! what's the matter?" the woman continued;
"that don't suit you, madame, eh? Excuse me! you
ought to have told me beforehand. How old do you
suppose she is, Mélie, eh? <i>Sapristi!</i> You select young
ones, my boy, you don't put yourself out!"</p>

<p>Jupillon smiled internally, and simpered and sneered
externally. His whole manner displayed the cowardly
delight that evil-minded persons take in watching the
suffering of those who suffer because of loving them.</p>

<p>"I have something to say to you&mdash;to you!&mdash;not here&mdash;outside,"
said Germinie.</p>

<p>"Much joy to you! Coming, Mélie?" said the
woman in the hood, lighting the stub of a cigar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
that Jupillon had left on the table beside a piece of
lemon.</p>

<p>"What do you want?" said Jupillon, impressed, in
spite of himself, by Germinie's tone.</p>

<p>"Come!"</p>

<p>And she walked on ahead of him. As she passed, the
people crowded about her, laughing. She heard voices,
broken sentences, subdued hooting.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span></p>





<hr />
<h2 class="chapter">XVII</h2>


<p>Jupillon promised Germinie not to go to the ball<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
again. But he was just beginning to make a name for
himself at La Brididi, among the low haunts near the
barrier, the <i>Boule-Noire</i>, the <i>Reine-Blanche</i> and the
<i>Ermitage</i>. He had become one of the dancers who
make the guests leave their seats, who keep a whole
roomful of people hanging on the soles of their boots
as they toss them two inches above their heads, and
whom the fair dancers of the locality invite to dance
with them and sometimes pay for their refreshment to
that end. The ball to him was not a ball simply; it
was a stage, an audience, popularity, applause, the
flattering murmur of his name among the groups of
people, an ovation accorded to saltatory glory in the
glare of the reverberators.</p>

<p>On Sunday he did not go to the <i>Boule-Noire</i>; but on
the following Thursday he went there again; and Germinie,
seeing plainly enough that she could not prevent
him from going, decided to follow him and to stay there
as long as he did. Sitting at a table in the background,
in the least brilliantly lighted corner of the ball-room,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
she would follow him eagerly with her eyes throughout
the whole contra-dance; and when it was at an end, if
he held back, she would go and seize him, take him
almost by force from the hands and caresses of the
women who persisted in trying to pull him back, to
detain him by wicked wiles.</p>

<p>As they soon came to know her, the insulting remarks
in her neighborhood ceased to be vague and indistinct
and muttered under the breath, as at the first ball. The
words were thrown in her face, the laughter spoke aloud.
She was obliged to pass her three hours amid a chorus of
derision that pointed its finger at her, called her by name
and cast her age in her face. At every turn she was forced
to submit to the appellation of: <i>old woman!</i> which the
young hussies spat at her over their shoulders as they
passed. But they did at least look at her; often, however,
dancing women invited by Jupillon to drink, and brought
by him to the table at which Germinie was, would sit
with their elbows on the table and their cheeks resting
on their hands, drinking the bowl of mulled wine for
which she paid, apparently unaware that there was
another woman there, crowding into her place as if it
were unoccupied, and making no reply when she spoke
to them. Germinie could have killed these creatures
whom Jupillon forced her to entertain and who despised
her so utterly that they did not even notice her presence.</p>

<p>The time arrived, when, having endured all she could
endure and being sickened by the humiliation she was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
forced to swallow, she conceived the idea of dancing
herself. She saw no other way to avoid leaving her
lover to others, to keep him by her all the evening, and
perhaps to bind him more closely to her by her success,
if she had any chance of succeeding. Throughout a
whole month she worked, in secret, to learn to dance.
She rehearsed the figures and the steps. She forced her
body into unnatural attitudes, she wore herself out trying
to master the contortions and the manipulations of the
skirt that she saw were applauded. At the end of the
month she made the venture; but everything tended to
disconcert her and added to her awkwardness; the
hostility that she could feel in the atmosphere, the smiles
of astonishment and pity that played about the lips of
the spectators when she took her place in the dancers'
enclosure. She was so absurd and so laughed at, that
she had not the courage to make a second attempt. She
buried herself gloomily in her dark corner, only leaving
it to hunt up Jupillon and carry him off, with the mute
violence of a wife dragging her husband out of the
wineshop and leading him home by the arm.</p>

<p>It was soon rumored in the street that Germinie went
to these balls, that she never missed one of them. The
fruit woman, at whose shop Adèle had already held
forth, sent her son "to see;" he returned with a confirmation
of the rumor, and told of all the petty annoyances
to which Germinie was subjected, but which did
not keep her from returning. Thereafter there was no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
more doubt in the quarter as to the relations between
mademoiselle's servant and Jupillon&mdash;relations which
some charitable souls had hitherto persisted in denying.
The scandal burst out, and in a week the poor girl,
berated by all the slanderous tongues in the quarter,
baptized and saluted by the vilest names in the language
of the streets, fell at a blow from the most emphatically
expressed esteem to the most brutally advertised
contempt.</p>

<p>Thus far her pride&mdash;and it was very great&mdash;had procured
for her the respect and consideration which is
bestowed, in the lorette quarters, upon a servant who
honestly serves a virtuous mistress. She had become
accustomed to respect and deference and attention.
She stood apart from her comrades. Her unassailable
probity, her conduct, as to which not a word could be
said, her confidential relations with mademoiselle, which
caused her mistress's honorable character to be reflected
upon her, led the shopkeeper to treat her on a different
footing from the other maids. They addressed her, cap
in hand; they always called her <i>Mademoiselle Germinie</i>.
They hurried to wait upon her; they offered her the only
chair in the shop when she had to wait. Even when she
contended over prices they were still polite with her and
never called her <i>haggler</i>. Jests that were somewhat too
broad were cut short when she appeared. She was
invited to the great banquets, to family parties, and
consulted upon business matters.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>Everything changed as soon as her relations with
Jupillon and her assiduous attendance at the <i>Boule-Noire</i>
were known. The quarter took its revenge for
having respected her. The brazen-faced maids in the
house accosted her as one of their own kind. One,
whose lover was at Mazas, called her: "My dear."
The men accosted her familiarly, and with all the
intimacy of thee and thou in glance and gesture and
tone and touch. The very children on the sidewalk,
who were formerly trained to courtesy politely to her,
ran away from her as from a person of whom they had
been told to be afraid. She felt that she was being
maligned behind her back, handed over to the devil.
She could not take a step without walking through scorn
and receiving a blow from her shame upon the cheek.</p>

<p>It was a horrible affliction to her. She suffered as if
her honor were being torn from her, shred by shred,
and dragged in the gutter. But the more she suffered,
the closer she pressed her love to her heart and clung to
him. She bore him no ill-will, she uttered no word of
reproach to him. She attached herself to him by all
the tears he caused her pride to shed. And now, in the
street through which she passed but a short time ago,
proudly and with head erect, she could be seen, bent
double as if crouching over her fault, hurrying furtively
along, with oblique glances, dreading to be recognized,
quickening her pace in front of the shops that swept
their slanders out upon her heels.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>




<hr />
<h2 class="chapter">XVIII</h2>


<p>Jupillon was constantly complaining that he was tired<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
of working for others, that he could not set up for himself,
that he could not find fifteen or eighteen hundred
francs in his mother's purse. He needed no more than
that, he said, to hire a couple of rooms on the ground
floor and set up as a glover in a small way. Indeed he
was already dreaming of what he might do and laying
out his plans: he would open a shop in the quarter, an
excellent quarter for his business, as it was full of purchasers,
and of makers of wretched gloves at five francs.
He would soon add a line of perfumery and cravats to
his gloves; and then, when he had made a tidy sum, he
would sell out and take a fine shop on Rue de Richelieu.</p>

<p>Whenever he mentioned the subject Germinie asked
him innumerable questions. She wanted to know everything
that was necessary to start in business. She made
him tell her the names of the tools and appurtenances,
give her an idea of their prices and where they could be
bought. She questioned him as to his trade and the details
of his work so inquisitively and persistently that Jupillon
lost his patience at last and said to her:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>"What's all this to you? The work sickens me
enough now; don't mention it to me!"</p>

<p>One Sunday she walked toward Montmartre with him.
Instead of taking Rue Frochot she turned into Rue Pigalle.</p>

<p>"Why, this ain't the way, is it?" said Jupillon.</p>

<p>"I know what I'm about," said she, "come on."</p>

<p>She had taken his arm, and she walked on, turning her
head slightly away from him so that he could not see what
was taking place on her face. Half way along Rue Fontaine
Saint-Georges, she halted abruptly in front of two
windows on the ground floor of a house, and said to
him: "Look!"</p>

<p>She was trembling with joy.</p>

<p>Jupillon looked; he saw between the two windows,
on a glistening copper plate:</p>

<div class="nanospace">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="center">
<i>Magasin de Ganterie.</i><br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">Jupillon.</span>
</div>
<div class="minispace">&nbsp;</div>

<p>He saw white curtains at the first window. Through
the glass in the other he saw pigeon-holes and boxes,
and, near the window, the little glover's cutting board,
with the great shears, the jar for clippings, and the knife
to make holes in the skins in order to stretch them.</p>

<p>"The concierge has your key," she said.</p>

<p>They entered the first room, the shop.</p>

<p>She at once set about showing him everything. She
opened the boxes and laughed. Then she pushed open
the door into the other room. "There, you won't be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
stifled there as you are in the loft at your mother's. Do
you like it? Oh! it isn't handsome, but it's clean.
I'd have liked to give you mahogany. Do you like that
little rug by the bed? And the paper&mdash;I didn't think
of that&mdash;&mdash;" She put a receipt for the rent in his hand.
"See! this is for six months. Dame! you must go to
work right off and earn some money. The few sous I
had laid by are all gone. Oh! let me sit down. You
look so pleased&mdash;it gives me a turn&mdash;it makes my head
spin. I haven't any legs."</p>

<p>And she sank into a chair. Jupillon stooped over her
to kiss her.</p>

<p>"Ah! yes, they're not there any longer," she said,
seeing that he was looking for her earrings. "They've
gone like my rings. D'ye see, all gone&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>And she showed him her hands, bare of the paltry
gems she had worked so long to buy.</p>

<p>"They all went for the easy-chair, you see&mdash;but it's
all horsehair."</p>

<p>As Jupillon stood in front of her with an embarrassed
air, as if he were trying to find words with which to
thank her, she continued:</p>

<p>"Why, you're a funny fellow. What's the matter
with you? Ah! it's on that account, is it?" And she
pointed to the bedroom. "You're a stupid! I love you,
don't I? Well then?"</p>

<p>Germinie said the words simply, as the heart says
sublime things.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span></p>




<hr />
<h2 class="chapter">XIX</h2>


<p>She became <i>enceinte</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>At first she doubted, she dared not believe it. But
when she was certain of the fact, she was filled with
immeasurable joy, a joy that overflowed her heart. Her
happiness was so great and so overpowering that it stifled
at a single stroke the anguish, the fear, the inward trembling
that ordinarily disturb the maternity of unmarried
women and poisons their anticipations of childbirth, the
divine hope that lives and moves within them. The
thought of the scandal caused by the discovery of her
<i>liaison</i>, of the outcry in the quarter, the idea of the
abominable thing that had always made her think of
suicide: dishonor,&mdash;even the fear of being detected by
mademoiselle and dismissed by her&mdash;nothing of all this
could cast a shadow on her felicity. The child that she
expected allowed her to see nothing but it, as if she
had it already in her arms before her; and, hardly
attempting to conceal her condition, she bore her
woman's shame almost proudly through the streets,
exulting and radiant in the thought that she was to be
a mother.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span></p>

<p>She was unhappy only because she had spent all her
savings, and was not only without money but had been
paid several months' wages in advance by her mistress.
She bitterly deplored having to receive her child in a
poor way. Often, as she passed through Rue Saint-Lazare,
she would stop in front of a linen-draper's, in
whose windows were displayed stores of rich baby-linen.
She would devour with her eyes the pretty, dainty flowered
garments, the piqué bibs, the long short-waisted
dresses trimmed with English embroidery, the whole
doll-like cherub's costume. A terrible longing,&mdash;the
longing of a pregnant woman,&mdash;to break the glass and
steal it all, would come upon her: the clerks standing
behind the display framework became accustomed to seeing
her take up her station there and would laughingly
point her out to one another.</p>

<p>Again, at intervals, amid the happiness that overflowed
her heart, amid the ecstasy that exalted her being,
another disturbing thought passed through her mind.
She would ask herself how the father would welcome his
child. Two or three times she had attempted to tell
him of her condition but had not dared. At last, one
day, seeing that his face wore the expression she had
awaited so long as a preliminary to telling him everything,
an expression in which there was a touch of
affection, she confessed to him, blushing hotly and as if
asking his forgiveness, what it was that made her so
happy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>"That's all imagination!" said Jupillon.</p>

<p>And when she had assured him that it was not imagination
and that she was positively five months advanced
in pregnancy: "Just my luck!" the young man
rejoined. "Thanks!" And he swore. "Would you
mind telling me who's going to feed the sparrow?"</p>

<p>"Oh! never you fear! it sha'n't suffer, I'll look out
for that. And then it'll be so pretty! Don't be afraid,
no one shall know anything about it. I'll fix myself up.
See! the last part of the time I'll walk like this, with
my head back&mdash;I won't wear any petticoats, and I'll
pull myself in&mdash;you'll see! Nobody shall notice anything,
I tell you. Just think of it! a little child of
our own!"</p>

<p>"Well, as long as it's so, it's so, eh?" said the young
man.</p>

<p>"Say," ventured Germinie, timidly, "suppose you
should tell your mother?"</p>

<p>"Ma? Oh! no, I rather think not. You must lie
in first. After that we'll take the brat to the house. It
will give her a start, and perhaps she'll consent without
meaning to."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>




<hr />
<h2 class="chapter">XX</h2>


<p>Twelfth Night arrived. It was the day on which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
Mademoiselle de Varandeuil gave a grand dinner-party
regularly every year. She invited all the children of
her own family or her old friends' families, great and
small. The small suite would hardly hold them all.
They were obliged to put part of the furniture on the
landing, and a table was set in each of the two rooms
which formed mademoiselle's whole suite. For the
children, that day was a great festival to which they
looked forward for a week. They came running up the
stairway behind the pastry-cook's men. At table they
ate too much without being scolded. At night, they
were unwilling to go to bed, they climbed on the chairs
and made a racket that always gave Mademoiselle de
Varandeuil a sick headache the next day; but she bore
them no grudge therefor: she had had the full enjoyment
of a genuine grandmother's fête, in listening to
them, looking at them, tying around their necks the
white napkins that made them look so rosy. And not
for anything in the world would she have failed to give
this dinner-party, which filled her old maid's apartments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
with the fair-haired little imps of Satan, and brought
thither, in a single day, an atmosphere of activity and
youth and laughter that lasted a whole year.</p>

<p>Germinie was preparing the dinner. She was whipping
cream in an earthen bowl on her knees, when
suddenly she felt the first pains. She looked at her face
in the bit of a broken mirror that she had above her
kitchen dresser, and saw that she was pale. She went
down to Adèle: "Give me your mistress's rouge," she
said. And she put some on her cheeks. Then she
went up again, and, refusing to listen to the voice of
her suffering, finished cooking the dinner. It had to
be served, and she served it. At dessert, she leaned
against the furniture and grasped the backs of chairs
as she passed the plates, hiding her torture with
the ghastly set smile of people whose entrails are
writhing.</p>

<p>"How's this, are you sick?" said her mistress, looking
sharply at her.</p>

<p>"Yes, mademoiselle, a little&mdash;it may be the charcoal
or the hot kitchen."</p>

<p>"Go to bed&mdash;we don't need you any more, and you
can clean up to-morrow."</p>

<p>She went down to Adèle once more.</p>

<p>"It's come," she said; "call a cab quick. It was
Rue de la Huchette where you said your midwife lives,
wasn't it? opposite a copper planer's? Haven't you a
pen and paper?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>And she sat down to write a line to her mistress. She
told her that she was too ill to work, that she had gone
to the hospital, but would not tell her where, because
she would fatigue herself coming to see her; that she
would come back within a week.</p>

<p>"There you are!" said Adèle, all out of breath, giving
her the number of the cab.</p>

<p>"I can stay there," said Germinie; "not a word to
mademoiselle. That's all. Swear you won't say a
word to her!"</p>

<p>She was descending the stairs when she met Jupillon.</p>

<p>"Hallo!" said he, "where are you going? going
out?"</p>

<p>"I am going to lie in&mdash;&mdash;It took me during the
day. There was a great dinner-party here&mdash;&mdash;Oh!
but it was hard work! Why do you come here? I
told you never to come; I don't want you to!"</p>

<p>"Because&mdash;&mdash;I'll tell you&mdash;&mdash;because just now I
absolutely must have forty francs. 'Pon my word, I
must."</p>

<p>"Forty francs! Why I have just that for the midwife!"</p>

<p>"That's hard luck&mdash;&mdash;look out! What do you
want to do?" And he offered his arm to assist her.
"<i>Cristi!</i> I'm going to have hard work to get 'em all
the same."</p>

<p>He had opened the carriage door.</p>

<p>"Where do you want him to take you?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>"To La Bourbe," said Germinie. And she slipped
the forty francs into his hand.</p>

<p>"No, no," said Jupillon.</p>

<p>"Oh! nonsense&mdash;&mdash;there or somewhere else! Besides,
I have seven francs left."</p>

<p>The cab started away.</p>

<p>Jupillon stood for a moment motionless on the sidewalk,
looking at the two napoleons in his hand. Then
he ran after the cab, stopped it, and said to Germinie
through the window:</p>

<p>"At least, I can go with you?"</p>

<p>"No, I am in too much pain, I'd rather be alone,"
she replied, writhing on the cushions of the cab.</p>

<p>After an endless half hour, the cab stopped on Rue
de Port-Royal, in front of a black door surmounted by
a violet lantern, which announced to such medical
students as happened to pass through the street that
there was that night, and at that moment, the curious
and interesting spectacle of a difficult labor in progress
at La Maternité.</p>

<p>The driver descended from his box and rang. The
concierge, assisted by a female attendant, took Germinie's
arms and led her up-stairs to one of the four
beds in the <i>salle d'accouchement</i>. Once in bed, her
pains became somewhat less excruciating. She looked
about her, saw the other beds, all empty, and, at the
end of the immense room, a huge country-house fireplace
in which a bright fire was blazing, and in front of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
which, hanging upon iron bars, sheets and cloths and
bandages were drying.</p>

<p>Half an hour later, Germinie gave birth to a little
girl. Her bed was moved into another room. She had
been there several hours, lost in the blissful after-delivery
weakness which follows the frightful agony of childbirth,
happy and amazed to find that she was still alive, swimming
in a sea of blessed relief and deeply penetrated
with the joy of having created. Suddenly a loud cry:
"I am dying!" caused her to turn her eyes in the
direction from which it came: she saw one of her
neighbors throw her arms around the neck of one of the
assistant nurses, fall back almost instantly, move a moment
under the clothes, then lie perfectly still. Almost
at the same instant, another shriek arose from a bed on
the other side, a horrible, piercing, terrified shriek, as of
one who sees death approaching: it was a woman calling
the young assistant, with desperate gestures; the
assistant ran to her, leaned over her, and fell in a dead
faint upon the floor.</p>

<p>Thereupon silence reigned once more; but between
the two dead bodies and the half-dead assistant, whom
the cold floor did not restore to consciousness for more
than an hour, Germinie and the other women who were
still alive in the room lay quiet, not daring even to ring
the bell that hung beside each bed to call for help.</p>

<p>Thereafter La Maternité was the scene of one of those
terrible puerperal epidemics which breathe death upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
human fecundity, of one of those cases of atmospheric
poisoning which empty, in a twinkling and by whole
rows, the beds of women lately delivered, and which
once caused the closing of La Clinique. They believed
that it was a visitation of the plague, a plague that
turns the face black in a few hours, carries all before it
and snatches up the youngest and the strongest, a plague
that issues from the cradle&mdash;the Black Plague of
mothers! All about Germinie, at all hours, especially
at night, women were dying such deaths as the milk-fever
causes, deaths that seemed to violate all nature's
laws, agonizing deaths, accompanied by wild shrieks
and troubled by hallucinations and delirium, death
agonies that compelled the application of the strait-waistcoat,
death agonies that caused the victims to leap
suddenly from their beds, carrying the clothes with them,
and causing the whole room to shudder at the thought
that they were dead bodies from the amphitheatre!
Life departed as if it were torn from the body. The
very disease assumed a ghastly shape and monstrous
aspect. The bedclothes were lifted in the centre by
the swelling caused by peritonitis, producing a vague,
horrifying effect in the lamplight.</p>

<p>For five days Germinie, lying swathed and bandaged
in her bed, closing her eyes and ears as best she could,
had the strength to combat all these horrors, and yielded
to them only at long intervals. She was determined to
live, and she clung to her strength by thinking of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
child and of mademoiselle. But, on the sixth day, her
energy was exhausted, her courage forsook her. A cold
wave flowed into her heart. She said to herself that it
was all over. The hand that death lays upon one's
shoulder, the presentiment of death, was already touching
her. She felt the first breath of the epidemic, the
belief that she was its destined victim, and the impression
that she was already half-possessed by it. Although
unresigned, she succumbed. Her life, vanquished beforehand,
hardly made an effort to struggle. At that
crisis a head bent over her pillow, like a ray of light.</p>

<p>It was the head of the youngest of the pupil-assistants,
a fair head, with long golden locks and blue eyes
so soft and sweet that the dying saw heaven opening its
gates therein. When they saw her, delirious women
said: "Look! the Blessed Virgin!"</p>

<p>"My child," she said to Germinie, "you must ask
for your discharge at once. You must go away from
here. You must dress warmly. You must wrap up
well. As soon as you're at home and in bed, you must
take a hot draught of something or other. You must
try to take a sweat. Then, it won't do you any harm.
But go away from here. It wouldn't be healthy for you
here to-night," she said, glancing around at the beds.
"Don't say that I told you to go: you would get me
discharged if you should."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>




<hr />
<h2 class="chapter">XXI</h2>


<p>Germinie recovered in a few days. The joy and pride<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
of having given birth to a tiny creature in whom her
flesh was mingled with the flesh of the man she loved,
the bliss of being a mother, saved her from the natural
results of a confinement in which she did not receive
proper care. She was restored to health and had an
apparent pleasure in living that her mistress had never
before seen her manifest.</p>

<p>Every Sunday, no matter what the weather might be,
she left the house about eleven o'clock; mademoiselle
believed that she went to see a friend in the country,
and was delighted that her maid derived so much benefit
from these days passed in the open air. Germinie would
capture Jupillon, who allowed himself to be taken in
tow without too much resistance, and they would start
for Pommeuse where the child was, and where a good
breakfast ordered by the mother awaited them. Once
in the carriage on the Mulhouse railway, Germinie
would not speak or reply when spoken to. She would
lean out of the window, and all her thoughts seemed to
be upon what lay before her. She gazed, as if her longing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
were striving to outrun the steam. The train would
hardly have stopped before she had leaped out, tossed
her ticket to the ticket-taker, and started at a run on the
Pommeuse road, leaving Jupillon behind. She drew
nearer and nearer, she could see the house, she was
there: yes, there was the child! She would pounce
upon her, snatch her from the nurse's arms with jealous
hands&mdash;a mother's hands!&mdash;hug her, strain her to her
heart, kiss her, devour her with kisses and looks and
smiles! She would gaze admiringly at her for an instant
and then, distraught with joy, mad with love, would
cover her with kisses to the tips of her little bare toes.
Breakfast would be served. She would sit at the table
with the child on her knees and eat nothing: she had
kissed her so much that she had not yet looked at her,
and she would begin to seek out points of resemblance
to themselves in the little one. One feature was his,
another hers:&mdash;"She has your nose and my eyes. Her
hair will be like yours in time. It will curl! Look,
those are your hands&mdash;she is all you." And for hours she
would continue the inexhaustible and charming prattle of
a woman who is determined to give a man his share of
their daughter. Jupillon submitted to it all with reasonably
good grace, thanks to divers three-sou cigars Germinie
always produced from her pocket and gave to him
one by one. Then he had found a means of diversion;
the Morin flowed at the foot of the garden. Jupillon
was a true Parisian: he loved to fish with a pole and line.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span></p>

<p>And when summer came they stayed there all day, at
the foot of the garden, on the bank of the stream&mdash;Jupillon
on a laundry board resting on two stakes, pole
in hand, and Germinie sitting, with the child in her
skirts, under the medlar tree that overhung the stream.
On pleasant days, the sun poured down upon the broad
sparkling current, from which beams of light arose as
from a mirror. It was like a display of fireworks from
the sky and the stream, amid which Germinie would
hold the little girl upon her feet and let her trample
upon her with her little bare pink legs, in her short
baby dress, her skin shimmering in spots in the sunlight,
her flesh mottled with sunbeams like the flesh
of angels Germinie had seen in pictures. She had a
divinely sweet sensation when the little one, with the
active hands of children that cannot talk, touched her
chin and mouth and cheeks, persisted in putting her
fingers in her eyes, rested them playfully on the lids,
and kept them moving over her whole face, tickling
and tormenting her with the dear little digits that
seem to grope in the dark for a mother's features:
it was as if her child's life and warmth were wandering
over her face. From time to time she would
bestow half of her smile on Jupillon over the little
one's head, and would call to him: "Do look at
her!"</p>

<p>Then the child would fall asleep with the open mouth
that laughs in sleep. Germinie would lean over her and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
listen to her breathing in repose. And, soothed by the
peaceful respiration, she would gradually forget herself
as she gazed dreamily at the poor abode of her happiness,
the rustic garden, the apple-trees with their leaves
covered with little yellow snails and the red-cheeked
apples on the southern limbs, the poles, at whose feet
the beanstalks, twisted and parched, were beginning to
climb, the square of cabbages, the four sunflowers in the
little circle in the centre of the path; and, close beside
her, on the edge of the stream, the patches of grass
covered with dog's mercury, the white heads of the nettles
against the wall, the washerwomen's boxes, the bottles
of lye and the bundle of straw scattered about by the
antics of a puppy just out of the water. She gazed and
dreamed. She thought of the past, having her future
on her knees. With the grass and the trees and the
river that were before her eyes, she reconstructed, in
memory, the rustic garden of her rustic childhood. She
saw again the two stones reaching down to the water,
from which her mother, when she was a little child, used
to wash her feet before putting her to bed in summertime.</p>

<p>"Look you, Père Remalard," said Jupillon from his
board, on one of the hottest days in August, to the
peasant who was watching him,&mdash;"do you know they
won't bite at the red worm worth a sou?"</p>

<p>"You must try the gentle," rejoined the peasant sententiously.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span></p>

<p>"All right, I'll have my revenge with the gentle!
Père Remalard, you must get some calf's lights Thursday.
You hang 'em up in that tree, and Sunday we'll
see."</p>

<p>On the Sunday Jupillon had miraculous success with
his fishing, and Germinie heard the first syllable issue
from her daughter's mouth.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>




<hr />
<h2 class="chapter">XXII</h2>


<p>On Wednesday morning, when she came downstairs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
Germinie found a letter for herself. In that letter,
written on the back of a laundry receipt, the Remalard
woman informed her that her child had fallen sick
almost immediately after her departure; that she had
grown steadily worse; that she had consulted the doctor;
that he said some insect had stung the child; that
she had been to him a second time; that she did not
know what more to do; that she had had pilgrimages
made for her. The letter concluded thus: "If you
could see how troubled I am for your little one&mdash;if you
could see how good she is when she isn't suffering!"</p>

<p>This letter produced upon Germinie the effect of
a push from behind. She went out and instinctively
walked toward the railroad that would take her to her
little one. Her hair was uncombed and she was in her
slippers, but she did not think of that. She must see
her child, she must see her instantly. Then she would
come back. She thought of mademoiselle's breakfast
for a moment, then forgot it. Suddenly, half-way to
the station, she saw a clock at a cab office and noticed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
the hour: she remembered that there was no train at
that time. She retraced her steps, saying to herself that
she would hurry the breakfast and then make some
excuse to be given her liberty for the rest of the day.
But when the breakfast was served she could find none:
her mind was so full of her child that she could not
invent a falsehood; her imagination was benumbed.
And then, if she had spoken, if she had made the
request, she would have betrayed herself; she could feel
the words upon her lips: "I want to go and see my
child!" At night she dared not make her escape;
mademoiselle had been a little indisposed the night
before; she was afraid that she might need her.</p>

<p>The next morning when she entered mademoiselle's
room with a fable she had invented during the night, all
ready to ask for leave of absence, mademoiselle said to
her, looking up from a letter that had just been sent
up to her from the lodge: "Ah! my old friend De
Belleuse wants you for the whole day to-day, to help her
with her preserves. Come, give me my two eggs, post-haste,
and off with you. Eh? what! doesn't that suit
you? What's the matter?"</p>

<p>"With me? why nothing at all!" Germinie found
strength to say.</p>

<p>All that endless day she passed standing over hot
stewpans and sealing up jars, in the torture known only
to those whom the chances of life detain at a distance
from the sick bed of those dear to them. She suffered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
such heart-rending agony as those unhappy creatures
suffer who cannot go where their anxiety calls them,
and who, in the extremity of despair caused by separation
and uncertainty, constantly imagine that death will
come in their absence.</p>

<p>As she received no letter Thursday evening and none
Friday morning, she took courage. If the little one were
growing worse the nurse would have written her. The
little one was better: she imagined her saved, cured.
Children are forever coming near dying, and they get
well so quickly! And then hers was strong. She decided
to wait, to be patient until Sunday, which was only
forty-eight hours away, deceiving the remainder of her
fears with the superstitions that say yes to hope, persuading
herself that her daughter had "escaped,"
because the first person she met in the morning was a
man, because she had seen a red horse in the street,
because she had guessed that a certain person would turn
into a certain street, because she had ascended a flight
of stairs in so many strides.</p>

<p>On Saturday, in the morning, when she entered Mère
Jupillon's shop, she found her weeping hot tears over a
lump of butter that she was covering with a moist cloth.</p>

<p>"Ah! it's you, is it?" said Mère Jupillon. "That
poor charcoal woman! See, I'm actually crying over
her! She just went away from here. You don't know&mdash;they
can't get their faces clean in their trade with anything
but butter. And here's her love of a daughter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>&mdash;she's
at death's door, you know, the dear child. That's
the way it is with us! Ah! <i>mon Dieu</i>, yes!&mdash;Well, as
I was saying, she said to her just now like this: 'Mamma,
I want you to wash my face in butter right away&mdash;for the
good God.'"</p>

<p>And Mère Jupillon began to sob.</p>

<p>Germinie had fled. All that day she was unable to
keep still. Again and again she went up to her chamber
to prepare the few things she proposed to take to her
little one the next day, to dress her cleanly, to make a
little special toilet for her in honor of her recovery. As
she went down in the evening to put Mademoiselle to
bed, Adèle handed her a letter that she had found for
her below.</p>



<hr />
<h2 class="chapter">XXIII</h2>


<p>Mademoiselle had begun to undress, when Germinie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
entered her bedroom, walked a few steps, dropped upon
a chair, and almost immediately, after two or three long-drawn,
deep, heart-breaking sighs, mademoiselle saw
her throw herself backward, wringing her hands, and at
last roll from the chair to the floor. She tried to lift her
up, but Germinie was shaken by such violent convulsions
that the old woman was obliged to let the frantic body
fall again upon the floor; for all the limbs, which were
for a moment contracted and rigid, lashed out to right
and left, at random, with the sharp report of the trigger
of a rifle, and threw down whatever they came in contact
with. At mademoiselle's shrieks on the landing, a
maid ran to a doctor's office near by but did not find
him; four other women employed in the house assisted
mademoiselle to lift Germinie up and carry her to the
bed in her mistress's room, on which they laid her after
cutting her corset lacings.</p>

<p>The terrible convulsions, the nervous contortions of
the limbs, the snapping of the tendons had ceased; but
her neck and her breast, which was uncovered where her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
dress was unbuttoned, moved up and down as if waves
were rising and falling under the skin, and the rustling
of the skirts showed that the movement extended to her
feet. Her head thrown back, her face flushed, her eyes
full of melancholy tenderness, of the patient agony we
see in the eyes of the wounded, the great veins clearly
marked under her chin, Germinie, breathing hard and
paying no heed to questions, raised her hands to her
neck and throat and clawed at them; she seemed to
be trying to tear out the sensation of something rising
and falling within her. In vain did they make her inhale
ether and drink orange-flower water; the waves of grief
that flowed through her body did not cease their action;
and her face continued to wear the same expression
of gentle melancholy and sentimental anxiety, which
seemed to place the suffering of the heart above the
suffering of the flesh in every feature. For a long time
everything seemed to wound her senses and to produce
a painful effect upon them&mdash;the bright light, the sound
of voices, the odor of the things about her. At last,
after an hour or more, a deluge of tears suddenly poured
from her eyes and put an end to the terrible crisis.
After that there was nothing more than an occasional
convulsive shudder in the overburdened body, soon
quieted by weariness and by general prostration. It was
possible to carry Germinie to her own room.</p>

<p>The letter Adèle handed her contained the news of
her daughter's death.</p>



<hr />
<h2 class="chapter">XXIV</h2>


<p>As a result of this crisis, Germinie fell into a state of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
dumb, brutish sorrow. For months she was insensible
to everything; for months, completely possessed and
absorbed by the thought of the little creature that was
no more, she carried her child's death in her entrails as
she had carried her life. Every evening, when she went
up to her chamber, she took the poor darling's little
cap and dress from the trunk at the foot of her bed.
She would gaze at them and touch them; she would lay
them out on the bed; she would sit for hours weeping
over them, kissing them, talking to them, saying the
things that a mother's bitter sorrow is wont to say to a
little daughter's ghost.</p>

<p>While weeping for her daughter the unhappy creature
wept for herself as well. A voice whispered to her that
she was saved had the child lived; that to have that
child to love was her Providence; that all that she
dreaded in herself would be expended upon that dear
head and be sanctified there&mdash;her affections, her unreasoning
impulses, her ardor, all the passions of her
nature. It seemed to her that she had felt her mother's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
heart soothing and purifying her woman's heart. In her
daughter she saw a sort of celestial vision that would
redeem her and make her whole, a little angel of
deliverance as it were, issuing from her errors to fight
for her and rescue her from the evil influences which
pursued her and by which she sometimes thought that
she was possessed.</p>

<p>When she began to recover from the first prostration
of despair, when, as the consciousness of life and the
perception of objects returned to her, she looked about
her with eyes that saw, she was aroused from her grief
by a more poignant cause of bitterness of spirit.</p>

<p>Madame Jupillon, who had become too stout and too
heavy to do what it was necessary for her to do at the
creamery, notwithstanding all the assistance rendered by
Germinie, had sent to her province for a niece of hers.
She was the embodiment of the blooming youth of the
country, a woman in whom there was still something of
the child, active and vivacious, with black eyes full of
sunlight, lips as round and red as cherries, the summer
heat of her province in her complexion, the warmth of
perfect health in her blood. Impulsive and ingenuous
as she was, the girl had, at first, drawn near to her
cousin, simply and naturally, obeying the law of attraction
that draws the young toward the young. She had
met his friendly advances with the immodesty of innocence,
artless effrontery, the liberties taught by life in
the country, the happy folly of a nature abounding in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
high spirits, and with all sorts of ignorant hardihood,
unblushing ingenuousness and rustic coquetry, against
which her cousin's vanity was without means of defence.
The child's presence deprived Germinie of all hope of
repose. Mere girl as she was, she wounded her every
minute in the day by her presence, her touch, her
caresses, everything in her amorous body that spoke of
love. Her preoccupation with Jupillon, the work that
kept them constantly together, the provincial wonderment
that she constantly exhibited, the half-confidences
she allowed to come to her lips when the young man had
gone, her gayety, her jests, her healthy good-humor&mdash;everything
helped to exasperate Germinie and to arouse
a sullen wrath within her; everything wounded that
jealous heart, so jealous that the very animals caused it a
bitter pang by seeming to love someone whom it loved.</p>

<p>She dared not speak to Mère Jupillon and denounce
the little one to her, for fear of betraying herself; but
whenever she found herself alone with Jupillon she
vented her feelings in recriminations, complaints and
quarrels. She would remind him of an incident, a word,
something he had done or said, some answer he had made,
a trifle forgotten by him but still bleeding in her heart.</p>

<p>"Are you mad?" Jupillon would say to her; "a slip
of a girl!"&mdash;"A slip of a girl, eh? nonsense!&mdash;when
she has such eyes that all the men stare at her in the
street! I went out with her the other day&mdash;I was
ashamed&mdash;I don't know how she did it, but we were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
followed by a gentleman all the time."&mdash;"Well, what if
you were? She's a pretty girl, you know!"&mdash;"Pretty!
pretty!" And at that word Germinie would hurl herself,
figuratively speaking, at the girl's face, and claw it
to pieces with frantic words.</p>

<p>Often she would end by saying to Jupillon: "Look
here! you love her!"&mdash;"Well! what then?" he would
retort, highly entertained by these disputes, by the opportunity
to watch the antics of this fierce wrath which he
fanned with pretended sulkiness, and by the excitement
of trifling with the woman, whom he saw to be half
insane under his sarcasms and his indifference, stumbling
wildly about and running her head against stone
walls in the first paroxysms of madness.</p>

<p>As a result of these scenes, repeated almost every day,
a revolution took place in that excitable, extreme character,
which knew no middle course, in that heart in
which the most violent passions were constantly clashing.
Love, in which poison had long been at work,
became decomposed and changed to hate. Germinie
began to detest her lover and to seek out every possible
pretext for hating him more. And her thoughts recurred
to her daughter, to the loss of her child, to the cause of
her death, and she persuaded herself that he had killed
her. She looked upon him as an assassin. She conceived
a horror of him, she avoided him, fled from him
as from the evil genius of her life, with the terror that
one has of a person who is one's Bane!</p>



<hr />
<h2 class="chapter">XXV</h2>


<p>One morning, after a night passed by her in turning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
over and over in her mind all her despairing, hate-ridden
thoughts, Germinie went to the creamery for her
four sous' worth of milk and found in the back-shop
three or four maids from the neighborhood engaged in
"taking an eye-opener." They were seated at a table,
gossiping and sipping liqueurs.</p>

<p>"Aha!" said Adèle, striking the table with her glass;
"you here already, Mademoiselle de Varandeuil?"</p>

<p>"What's this?" said Germinie, taking Adèle's glass;
"I'd like some myself."</p>

<p>"Are you so thirsty as all that this morning? Brandy
and absinthe, that's all!&mdash;my soldier boy's <i>tap</i>, you
know,&mdash;he never drank anything else. It's a little stiff,
eh?"</p>

<p>"Ah! yes," said Germinie, contracting her lips and
winking like a child who is given a glass of liqueur with
the dessert at a grand dinner-party.</p>

<p>"It's good, all the same." Her spirits rose. "Madame
Jupillon, let's have the bottle&mdash;I'll pay."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<p>And she tossed money on the table. After the third
glass, she cried: "I am <i>tight</i>!" And she roared with
laughter.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle de Varandeuil had gone out that morning
to collect her half-yearly income. When she returned
at eleven o'clock, she rang once, twice! no one
came. "Ah!" she said to herself, "she must have
gone down." She opened the door with her key, went
to her bedroom and looked in: the mattress and bedclothes
lay in a heap on two chairs, and Germinie was
stretched out across the straw under-mattress, sleeping
heavily, like a log, in the utterly relaxed condition following
a sudden attack of lethargy.</p>

<p>At the noise made by mademoiselle, Germinie sprang
to her feet and passed her hand over her eyes.&mdash;"Yes?"
she said, as if some one had called her; her eyes were
wandering.</p>

<p>"What's happened?" said Mademoiselle de Varandeuil
in alarm; "did you fall? Is anything the matter
with you?"</p>

<p>"With me? no," Germinie replied; "I fell asleep.
What time is it? Nothing's the matter. Ah! what a
fool!"</p>

<p>And she began to shake the mattress, turning her
back to her mistress to hide the flush of intoxication on
her face.</p>



<hr />
<h2 class="chapter">XXVI</h2>


<p>One Sunday morning Jupillon was dressing in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
room Germinie had furnished for him. His mother was
sitting by, gazing at him with the wondering pride expressed
in the eyes of mothers among the common people
in presence of a son who dresses like a <i>monsieur</i>.</p>

<p>"You're dressed up like the young man on the first
floor!" she said. "I should think it was his coat. I
don't mean to say fine things don't look well on you,
too&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Jupillon, intent upon tying his cravat, made no reply.</p>

<p>"You'll play the deuce with the poor girls to-day!"
continued Mère Jupillon, giving to her voice an accent
of insinuating sweetness: "Look you, bibi, let me tell
you this, you great bad boy: if a young woman goes
wrong, so much the worse for her! that's their look-out.
You're a man, aren't you? you've got the age and the
figure and everything. I can't always keep you in leading-strings.
So, I said to myself, as well one as another.
That one will do. And I fixed her so that she wouldn't
see anything. Yes, Germinie would do, as you seemed
to like her. That prevented you from wasting your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
money on bad women&mdash;and then I didn't see anything
out of the way in the girl till now. But now it won't
do at all. They're telling stories in the quarter&mdash;a heap
of horrible things about us. A pack of vipers! We're
above all that, I know. When one has been an honest
woman all her life, thank God! But you never know
what will happen&mdash;mademoiselle would only have to put
the end of her nose into her maid's affairs. Why there's
the law&mdash;the bare idea gives me a turn. What do you
say to that, bibi, eh?"</p>

<p>"<i>Dame</i>, mamma,&mdash;whatever you please."</p>

<p>"Ah! I knew you loved your dear darling mamma!"
exclaimed the monstrous creature embracing him.
"Well! invite her to dinner to-night. You can get
up two bottles of our Lunel&mdash;at two francs&mdash;the heady
kind. And be sure she comes. Make eyes at her, so
that she'll think to-day's the great day. Put on your
fine gloves: they'll make you look more dignified."</p>

<p>Germinie arrived at seven o'clock, happy and bright
and hopeful, her head filled with blissful dreams by the
mysterious air with which Jupillon delivered his mother's
invitation. They dined and drank and made merry.
Mère Jupillon began to cast glances expressive of deep
emotion, drowned in tears, upon the couple sitting
opposite her. When the coffee was served, she said, as
if for the purpose of being left alone with Germinie:
"Bibi, you know you have an errand to do this
evening."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span></p>

<p>Jupillon went out. Madame Jupillon, as she sipped
her coffee, turned to Germinie the face of a mother
seeking to learn her daughter's secret, and, in her indulgence,
forgiving her in advance of her confession.
For a moment the two women sat thus, silent, one waiting
for the other to speak, the other with the cry of her
heart on her lips. Suddenly Germinie rushed from her
chair into the stout woman's arms.</p>

<p>"If you knew, Madame Jupillon!"</p>

<p>She talked and wept and embraced her all at once.
"Oh! you won't be angry with me! Well! yes, I
love him&mdash;I've had a child by him. It's true, I love
him. Three years ago&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>At every word Madame Jupillon's face became sterner
and more icy. She coldly pushed Germinie away, and
in her most doleful voice, with an accent of lamentation
and hopeless desolation, she began, like a person
who is suffocating: "Oh! my God&mdash;you!&mdash;tell me
such things as that!&mdash;me!&mdash;his mother!&mdash;to my face!
My God, must it be? My son&mdash;a child&mdash;an innocent
child! You've had the face to ruin him for me! And
now you tell me that you did it! No, it ain't possible,
my God! And I had such confidence. There's nothing
worth living for. There's no trusting anybody in
this world! All the same, mademoiselle, I wouldn't
ever 'a' believed it of you. <i>Dame!</i> such things give
me a turn. Ah! this upsets me completely. I know
myself, and I'm quite likely to be sick after this&mdash;&mdash;"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span></p>

<p>"Madame Jupillon! Madame Jupillon!" Germinie
murmured in an imploring tone, half dead with shame
and grief on the chair on which she had fallen. "I beg
you to forgive me. It was stronger than I was. And
then I thought&mdash;I believed&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You believed! Oh! my God; you believed! What
did you believe? That you'd be my son's wife, eh? Ah!
Lord God! is it possible, my poor child?"</p>

<p>And adopting a more and more plaintive and lamentable
tone as the words she hurled at Germinie cut deeper
and deeper, Mère Jupillon continued: "But, my poor
girl, you must have a reason, let's hear it. What did I
always tell you? That it would be all right if you'd been
born ten years earlier. Let's see, your date was 1820,
you told me, and now it's '49. You're getting on
toward thirty, you see, my dear child. I say! it makes
me feel bad to say that to you&mdash;I'd so much rather not
hurt you. But a body only has to look at you, my poor
young lady. What can I do? It's your age&mdash;your hair&mdash;I
can lay my finger in the place where you part it."</p>

<p>"But," said Germinie, in whose heart black wrath
was beginning to rumble, "what about what your son
owes me? My money? The money I took out of
the savings bank, the money I borrowed for him, the
money I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Money? he owes you money? Oh! yes, what you
lent him to begin business with. Well! what about it?
Do you think we're thieves? Does anyone want to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
cheat you out of your old money, although there wasn't
any paper&mdash;I know it because the other day&mdash;it just
occurs to me&mdash;that honest man of a child of mine wanted
to write it down for fear he might die. But the next
minute we're pickpockets, as glib as you please! Oh!
my God, it's hardly worth while living in such times as
these! Ah! I'm well paid for getting attached to you!
But I see through it now. You're a politician, you are!
You wanted to pay yourself with my son, for his whole
life! Excuse me! No, thank you! It costs less to
give back your money! A café waiter's leavings! my
poor dear boy! God preserve him from it!"</p>

<p>Germinie had snatched her shawl and hat from the
hook and was out of doors.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>




<hr />
<h2 class="chapter">XXVII</h2>


<p>Mademoiselle was sitting in her large armchair at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
corner of the fireplace, where a few live embers were
still sleeping under the ashes. Her black cap was pulled
down over her wrinkled forehead almost to her eyes.
Her black dress, cut in the shape of a child's frock, was
draped in scanty folds about her scanty body, showing
the location of every bone, and fell straight from her
knees to the floor. She wore a small black shawl crossed
on her breast and tied behind her back, as they are worn
by little girls. Her half-open hands were resting on her
hips, with the palms turned outward&mdash;thin, old woman's
hands, awkward and stiff, and swollen with gout at the
knuckles and finger joints. Sitting in the huddled,
crouching posture that compels old people to raise their
heads to look at you and speak to you, she seemed to
be buried in all that mass of black, whence nothing
emerged but her face, to which preponderance of bile
had imparted the yellow hue of old ivory, and the flashing
glance of her brown eyes. One who saw her thus,
her bright, sparkling eyes, the meagre body, the garb of
poverty and the noble air with which she bore all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
burdens of age, might well have fancied that he was
looking at a fairy on the stage of the Petits-Ménages.</p>

<p>Germinie was by her side. The old lady began:</p>

<p>"The list is still under the door, eh, Germinie?"</p>

<p>"Yes, mademoiselle."</p>

<p>"Do you know, my girl," Mademoiselle de Varandeuil
resumed, after a pause, "do you know that when
one is born in one of the finest houses on Rue Royale&mdash;when
one has been in a fair way to own the Grand and
Petit-Charolais&mdash;when one has almost had the Château
of Clichy-la-Garenne for a country house&mdash;and when it
took two servants to carry the silver platter on which
the joint was served at your grandmother's&mdash;do you
know that it takes no small amount of philosophy"&mdash;and
mademoiselle with difficulty raised a hand to her
shoulder&mdash;"to see yourself end like this, in this devilish
nest of rheumatism, where, in spite of all the list in the
world, you can't keep out of draughts.&mdash;That's it, stir up
the fire a little."</p>

<p>She put out her feet toward Germinie, who was kneeling
in front of the fireplace, and laughingly placed them
under her nose: "Do you know that that takes no small
amount of philosophy&mdash;to wear stockings out at heel!
Simpleton! I'm not scolding you; I know well enough
that you can't do everything. So you might as well have
a woman come to do the mending. That's not very
much to do. Why don't you speak to that little girl that
came here last year? She had a face that I remember."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh! she's black as a mole, mademoiselle."</p>

<p>"Bah! I knew it. In the first place you never think
well of anybody. That isn't true, you say? Why,
wasn't she a niece of Mère Jupillon's? We might take
her for one or two days a week."</p>

<p>"That hussy shall never set foot here."</p>

<p>"Nonsense, more fables! You're a most astonishing
creature, to adore people and then not want to see them
again. What has she done to you?"</p>

<p>"She's a lost creature, I tell you!"</p>

<p>"Bah! what does my linen care for that?"</p>

<p>"But, mademoiselle."</p>

<p>"All right! find me someone else then. I don't care
about her particularly. But find me someone."</p>

<p>"Oh! the women that come in like that don't do any
work. I'll mend your clothes. You don't need any
one."</p>

<p>"You!&mdash;Oh! if we have to rely on your needle!"
said mademoiselle jocosely; "and then, will Mère
Jupillon ever give you the time?"</p>

<p>"Madame Jupillon? Oh! for all the dust I shall
ever leave in her house again!"</p>

<p>"Hoity-toity! What's that? She too! so she's on
your black books, is she? Oho! hurry up and make
another acquaintance, or else, <i>bon Dieu de Dieu</i>! we
shall have some bad days here!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span></p>




<hr />
<h2 class="chapter">XXVIII</h2>


<p>The winter of that year should certainly have assured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
Mademoiselle de Varandeuil a share of paradise hereafter.
She had to undergo the reflex action of her
maid's chagrin, her nervous irritability, the vengeance
of her embittered, contradictory moods, which the
approaching spring would ere long infect with that
species of malignant madness which the critical season,
the travail of nature and the restless, disturbing fructification
of the summer cause in unhealthily sensitive
organizations.</p>

<p>Germinie was forever wiping eyes which no longer
wept, but which had once wept copiously. She was
always ready with an everlasting: "Nothing's the
matter, mademoiselle!" uttered in the tone that covers
a secret. She adopted dumb, despairing, funereal attitudes,
the airs by which a woman's body diffuses melancholy
and makes her very shadow a bore. With her
face, her glance, her mouth, the folds of her dress, her
presence, the noise she made at work in the adjoining
room, even with her silence, she enveloped mademoiselle
in the despair that exhaled from her person. At the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
slightest word she would bristle up. Mademoiselle
could not address an observation to her, ask her the
most trivial question, give her an order or express a
wish: everything was taken by her as a reproach. And
thereupon she would act like a madwoman. She would
wipe her eyes and grumble: "Oh! I am very unfortunate!
I can see that mademoiselle doesn't care for
me any more!" Her spite against various people vented
itself in sublimely ingenious complaints. "That woman
always comes when it rains!" she would say, upon discovering
a bit of mud that Madame de Belleuse had left
on the carpet. During the week following New Year's
Day, the week when all of Mademoiselle de Varandeuil's
remaining relatives and friends, rich and poor alike,
climbed the five flights and waited on the landing at her
door for their turns to occupy the six chairs in her bedroom,
Germinie redoubled her ill-humor, her impertinent
remarks, her sulky muttering. Inventing grievances
against her mistress, she punished her constantly
by a persistent silence, which it was impossible to break.
Then there would be periods of frenzied industry.
Mademoiselle would hear through the partitions on all
sides furious manipulation of the broom and duster,
the sharp, vicious scrubbing and slamming of the servant
whom one imagines muttering to herself as she maltreats
the furniture: "Oh! yes, I'll do your work for you!"</p>

<p>Old people are patient with servants who have been
long in their service. Long habit, the weakening will-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>power,
the horror of change, the dread of new faces,&mdash;everything
disposes them to weakness and cowardly
concessions. Notwithstanding her quick temper, her
promptness to lose her head, to fly into a rage, to
breathe fire and flame, mademoiselle said nothing. She
acted as if she saw nothing. She pretended to be reading
when Germinie entered the room. She waited,
curled up in her easy-chair, until the maid's ill-humor
had blown over or burst. She bent her back before the
storm; she said no word, had no thought of bitterness
against her. She simply pitied her for causing herself
so much suffering.</p>

<p>In truth Germinie was not Mademoiselle de Varandeuil's
maid; she was Devotion, waiting to close her
eyes. The solitary old woman, overlooked by death,
alone at the end of her life, dragging her affections
from grave to grave, had found her last friend in her
servant. She had rested her heart upon her as upon an
adopted daughter, and she was especially unhappy because
she was powerless to comfort her. Moreover, at
intervals, Germinie returned to her from the depths of
her brooding melancholy and her savage humor, and
threw herself on her knees before her kind heart.
Suddenly, at a ray of sunlight, a beggar's song, or any
one of the nothings that float in the air and expand
the heart, she would burst into tears and demonstrations
of affection; her heart would overflow with burning
emotions, she would seem to feel a pleasure in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
embracing her mistress, as if the joy of living again had
effaced everything. At other times some trifling ailment
of mademoiselle's would bring about the change;
a smile would come to the old servant's face and gentleness
to her hands. Sometimes, at such moments,
mademoiselle would say: "Come, my girl&mdash;something's
the matter. Tell me what it is." And Germinie
would reply: "No, mademoiselle, it's the weather."&mdash;"The
weather!" mademoiselle would repeat with a
doubtful air, "the weather!"</p>



<hr />
<h2 class="chapter">XXIX</h2>


<p>One evening in March the Jupillons, mother and son,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
were talking together by the stove in their back-shop.</p>

<p>Jupillon had been drafted. The money his mother
had put aside to purchase his release had been used up
as a result of six months of poor business and by credits
given to certain <i>lorettes</i> on the street, who had left the
key under their door-mat one fine morning. He had
not prospered, in a business way, himself, and his stock
in trade had been taken on execution. He had been
that day to ask a former employer to advance him the
money to purchase a substitute. But the old perfumer
had not forgiven him for leaving him and setting up for
himself, and he refused point-blank.</p>

<p>Mère Jupillon, in despair, was complaining tearfully.
She repeated the number drawn by her son: "Twenty-two!
twenty-two!" And she said: "And yet I sewed
a black spider into your <i>paletot</i> with his web; a <i>velvety</i>
fellow he was! Oh, dear! I ought to have done as they
told me and made you wear the cap you were baptized
in. Ah! the good God ain't fair! There's the fruit
woman's son drew a lucky number! That comes of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
being honest! And those two sluts at number eighteen
must go and hook it with my money! I might have
known they meant something by the way they shook
hands. They did me out of more than seven hundred
francs, did you know it? And the black creature opposite&mdash;and
that infernal girl as had the face to eat pots of
strawberries at twenty francs! they might as well have
taken me too, the hussies! But you haven't gone yet
all the same. I'd rather sell the creamery&mdash;I'll go out
to work again, do cooking or housekeeping,&mdash;anything!
Why, I'd draw money from a stone for you!"</p>

<p>Jupillon smoked and let his mother do the talking.
When she had finished, he said: "That'll do for talk,
mamma!&mdash;all that's nothing but words. You'll spoil
your digestion and it ain't worth while. You needn't
sell anything&mdash;you needn't strain yourself at all&mdash;I'll
buy my substitute and it sha'n't cost you a sou;&mdash;do you
want to bet on it?"</p>

<p>"Jesus!" ejaculated Madame Jupillon.</p>

<p>"I have an idea."</p>

<p>After a pause, Jupillon continued: "I didn't want to
make trouble with you on account of Germinie&mdash;you
know, at the time the stories about us were going round;
you thought it was time for me to break with her&mdash;that
she would be in our way&mdash;and you kicked her out of the
house, stiff. That wasn't my idea&mdash;I didn't think she
was so bad as all that for the family butter. But, however,
you thought best to do it. And perhaps, after all,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
you did the best thing; instead of cooling her off, you
warmed her up for me&mdash;yes, warmed her up&mdash;I've met
her once or twice&mdash;and she's changed, I tell you. Gad!
how she's drying up!"</p>

<p>"But you know very well she hasn't got a sou."</p>

<p>"I don't say she has, of her own. But what's that
got to do with it? She'll find it somewhere. She's good
for twenty-three hundred shiners yet!"</p>

<p>"But suppose you get mixed up in it?"</p>

<p>"Oh! she won't steal 'em&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"The deuce she won't!"</p>

<p>"Well! if she does, it won't be from anyone but her
mistress. Do you suppose her mademoiselle would have
her pinched for that? She'll turn her off, and that'll
be the end of it. We'll advise her to try the air in
another quarter&mdash;off she goes!&mdash;and we sha'n't see her
again. But it would be too stupid for her to steal.
She'll arrange it somehow, she'll hunt round and turn
things over. I don't know how, not I! but that's her
affair, you understand. This is the time for her to show
her talents. By the way, perhaps you don't know, they
say her old woman's sick. If the dear lady should happen
to step out and leave her all the stuff, as the story
goes in the quarter&mdash;why, it wouldn't be a bad thing
to have played see-saw with her, eh, mamma? We must
put on gloves, you see, mamma, when we're dealing
with people who may have four or five thousand a year
come tumbling into their aprons."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<p>"Oh! my God! what are you talking about? But
after the way I treated her&mdash;oh! no, she'll never come
back here."</p>

<p>"Well! I tell you I'll bring her back&mdash;and to-night
at the latest," said Jupillon, rising, and rolling a cigarette
between his fingers. "No excuses, you know," he
said to his mother, "they won't do any good&mdash;and
be cold to her. Act as if you received her only on
my account, because you are weak. No one knows
what may happen, we must always keep an anchor to
windward."</p>



<hr />
<h2 class="chapter">XXX</h2>


<p>Jupillon was walking back and forth on the sidewalk<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
in front of Germinie's house when she came out.</p>

<p>"Good-evening, Germinie," he said, behind her.</p>

<p>She turned as if she had been struck, and, without
answering his greeting, instinctively moved on a few
steps as if to fly from him.</p>

<p>"Germinie!"</p>

<p>Jupillon said nothing more than that; he did not
follow her, he did not move. She came back to him
like a trained beast when his rope is taken off.</p>

<p>"What is it?" said she. "Do you want more money?
or do you want to tell me some of your mother's foolish
remarks?"</p>

<p>"No, but I am going away," said Jupillon, with a
serious face. "I am drafted&mdash;and I am going away."</p>

<p>"You are going away?" said she. She seemed as if
her mind was not awake.</p>

<p>"Look here, Germinie," Jupillon continued. "I
have made you unhappy. I haven't been very kind to
you, I know. My cousin's been a little to blame.
What do you want?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>"You're going away?" rejoined Germinie, taking his
arm. "Don't lie to me&mdash;are you going away?"</p>

<p>"I tell you, yes&mdash;and it's true. I'm only waiting
for marching orders. You have to pay more than two
thousand francs for a substitute this year. They say
there's going to be a war: however, there's a chance."</p>

<p>As he spoke he was leading Germinie down the
street.</p>

<p>"Where are you taking me?" said she.</p>

<p>"To mother's, of course&mdash;so that you two can make
up and put an end to all this nonsense."</p>

<p>"After what she said to me? Never!"</p>

<p>And Germinie pushed Jupillon's arm away.</p>

<p>"Well, if that's the way it is, good-bye."</p>

<p>And Jupillon raised his cap.</p>

<p>"Shall I write to you from the regiment?"</p>

<p>Germinie was silent, hesitating, for a moment. Then
she said, abruptly: "Come on!" and, motioning to
Jupillon to walk beside her, she turned back up the
street.</p>

<p>And so they walked along, side by side, without a
word. They reached a paved road that stretched out as
far as the eye could see, between two lines of lanterns,
between two rows of gnarled trees that held aloft handfuls
of bare branches and cast their slender, motionless
shadows on high blank walls. There, in the keen air,
chilled by the evaporation of the snow, they walked on
and on for a long time, burying themselves in the vague,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
infinite, unfamiliar depths of a street that follows the
same wall, the same trees, the same lanterns, and leads
on to the same darkness beyond. The damp, heavy air
that they breathed smelt of sugar and tallow and carrion.
From time to time a vivid flash passed before their eyes:
it was the lantern of a butcher's cart that shone upon
slaughtered cattle and huge pieces of bleeding meat
thrown upon the back of a white horse; the light upon
the flesh, amid the darkness, resembled a purple conflagration,
a furnace of blood.</p>

<p>"Well! have you reflected?" said Jupillon. "This
little Avenue Trudaine isn't a very cheerful place, do
you know?"</p>

<p>"Come on," Germinie replied.</p>

<p>And, without another word, she set out again at the
same fierce, jerky gait, agitated by all the tumult raging
in her heart. Her thoughts were expressed in her gestures.
Her feet went astray, madness attacked her hands.
At times her shadow, seen from behind, reminded one of
a woman from La Salpêtrière. Two or three passers-by
stopped for a moment and looked after her; then, remembering
that they were in Paris, passed on.</p>

<p>Suddenly she stopped, and with the gesture of one
who has made a desperate resolution, she said: "Ah!
my God! another pin in the cushion!&mdash;Let us go!"</p>

<p>And she took Jupillon's arm.</p>

<p>"Oh! I know very well," said Jupillon, when they
were near the creamery, "my mother wasn't fair to you.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
You see, the woman has been too virtuous all her life.
She don't know, she don't understand. And then, d'ye
see, I'll tell you the whole secret: she loves me so much
she's jealous of any woman who loves me. So go in,
do!"</p>

<p>And he pushed her into the arms of Madame Jupillon,
who kissed her, mumbled a few words of regret, and
made haste to weep in order to relieve her own embarrassment
and make the scene more affecting.</p>

<p>Throughout the evening Germinie sat with her eyes
fixed on Jupillon, almost terrifying him with her expression.</p>

<p>"Come, come," he said, as he walked home with her,
"don't be so down in the mouth as all this. We must
have a little philosophy in this world. Well! here I am
a soldier&mdash;that's all! To be sure they don't all come
back. But then&mdash;look here! I propose that we enjoy
ourselves for the fortnight that's left, because it will be
so much gained&mdash;and if I don't come back&mdash;Well,
at all events, I shall leave you a pleasant memory of me."</p>

<p>Germinie made no reply.</p>



<hr />
<h2 class="chapter">XXXI</h2>


<p>For a whole week Germinie did not set foot in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
shop again.</p>

<p>The Jupillons, when she did not return, began to despair.
At last, one evening about half past ten, she
pushed the door open, entered the shop without a word
of greeting, walked up to the little table where the
mother and son were sitting half asleep, and placed upon
it, beneath her hand which was closed like a claw, an
old piece of cloth that gave forth a ringing sound.</p>

<p>"There it is!" said she.</p>

<p>And, letting go the corners of the cloth, she emptied
its contents on the table: forth came greasy bank-notes,
patched on the back, fastened together with pins, old
tarnished louis d'or, black hundred-sou pieces, forty-sou
pieces, ten-sou pieces, the money of the poor, the money
of toil, money from Christmas-boxes, money soiled by
dirty hands, worn out in leather purses, rubbed smooth
in the cash drawer filled with sous&mdash;money with a flavor
of perspiration.</p>

<p>For a moment she gazed at the display as if to assure
her own eyes; then she said to Madame Jupillon in a sad
voice, the voice of her sacrifice:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>"There it is&mdash;There's the two thousand three hundred
francs for him to buy a substitute."</p>

<p>"Oh! my dear Germinie!" said the stout woman,
almost suffocated by emotion; and she threw herself
upon Germinie's neck, who submitted to be embraced.
"Oh! you must take something with us&mdash;a cup of
coffee&mdash;"</p>

<p>"No, thank you," said Germinie; "I am done up.
<i>Dame!</i> I've had to fly around, you know, to get them.
I'm going to bed now. Some other time."</p>

<p>And she went away.</p>

<p>She had had to "fly around," as she said, to scrape
together such a sum, to accomplish that impossibility:
to raise two thousand three hundred francs&mdash;two thousand
three hundred francs, of which she had not the
first five! She had collected them, begged them, extorted
them piece by piece, almost sou by sou. She had
picked them up, scraped them together here and there,
from this one and from that one, by loans of two hundred,
one hundred, fifty, twenty francs, or whatever sum
anyone would lend. She had borrowed from her concierge,
her grocer, her fruit woman, her poulterer, her
laundress; she had borrowed from all the dealers in the
quarter, and from the dealers in the quarters where she
had previously lived with mademoiselle. She had made
up the amount with money drawn from every source,
even from her poor miserable water-carrier. She had
gone a-begging everywhere, importuned humbly, prayed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
implored, invented fables, swallowed the shame of lying
and of seeing that she was not believed. The humiliation
of confessing that she had no money laid by, as
was supposed, and as, through pride, she had encouraged
people to suppose, the sympathy of people she despised,
the refusals, the alms, she had undergone everything,
endured what she would not have endured to procure
bread for herself, and not once only, with a single
person, but with thirty, forty, all those who had given
her something or from whom she had hoped for something.</p>

<p>At last she had succeeded in collecting the money;
but it was her master and had possession of her forever.
Her life thenceforth belonged to the obligations
she had entered into with all these people, to the service
her dealers had rendered her, knowing very well what
they were doing. She belonged to her debt, to the sum
she would have to pay every year. She knew it; she
knew that all her wages would go in that way; that with
the rates of interest, which she had left entirely at the
discretion of her creditors, and the written obligations
demanded by them, mademoiselle's three hundred francs
would hardly suffice to pay the interest on the twenty-three
hundred she had borrowed. She knew that she
was in debt, that she should be in debt forever, that she
was doomed forever to privation and embarrassment, to
the strictest economy in her manner of living and her
dress. She had hardly any more illusions as to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
Jupillons than as to her own future. She had a presentiment
that her money was lost so far as they were
concerned. She had not even based any hopes on the
possibility that this sacrifice would touch the young man.
She had acted on the impulse of the moment. If she
had been told to die to prevent his going, she would
have died. The idea of seeing him a soldier, the idea
of the battlefield, the cannon, the wounded, in presence
of which a woman shuts her eyes in terror, had led her
to do something more than die; to sell her life for that
man, to consign herself to everlasting poverty.</p>

<h2 class="chapter">XXXII</h2>


<p>Disorders of the nervous system frequently result in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
disarranging the natural sequence of human joys and
sorrows, in destroying their proportion and equilibrium,
and in carrying them to the greatest possible excess. It
seems that, under the influence of this disease of sensitiveness,
the sharpened, refined, spiritualized sensations
exceed their natural measure and limits, reach a point
beyond themselves, and, as it were, make the enjoyment
and suffering of the individual infinite. So the infrequent
joys that Germinie still knew were insane joys,
from which she emerged drunk, and with the physical
symptoms of drunkenness.&mdash;"Why, my girl," mademoiselle
sometimes could not forbear saying, "anyone
would think you were tipsy."&mdash;"Mademoiselle makes
you pay dear for a little amusement once in a while!"
Germinie would reply. And when she relapsed into her
sorrowful, disappointed, restless condition, her desolation
was more intense, more frantic and delirious than
her gayety.</p>

<p>The moment had arrived when the terrible truth, which
she had suspected before, at last became clear to her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
She saw that she had failed to lay hold of Jupillon by
the devotion her love had manifested, by stripping herself
of all she possessed, by all the pecuniary sacrifices which
involved her life in the toils and embarrassment of a
debt it was impossible for her to pay. She felt that he
gave her his love grudgingly, a love to which he imparted
all the humiliation of an act of charity. When
she told him that she was again <i>enceinte</i>, the man whom
she was about to make a father once more said to her:
"Well, women like you are amusing creatures! always
full or just empty!" She conceived the ideas, the suspicions
that come to genuine love when it is betrayed,
the presentiments of the heart that tell women they
are no longer in undisputed possession of their lovers,
and that there is another because there is likely to be
another.</p>

<p>She complained no more, she wept no more, she indulged
no more in recrimination. She abandoned the
struggle with this man, armed with indifference, who,
with the cold-blooded sarcasm of the vulgar cad, was
so expert in insulting her passion, her unreasoning impulses,
her wild outbursts of affection. And so, in agonizing
resignation, she set herself the task of waiting&mdash;for
what? She did not know: perhaps until he would
have no more of her.</p>

<p>Heart-broken and silent, she kept watch upon Jupillon;
she followed him about and never lost sight of
him; she tried to make him speak by interjecting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
remarks in his fits of distraction. She hovered about
him, but she saw nothing wrong, she could lay hold of
nothing, detect nothing; and yet she was convinced
that there was something and that what she feared was
true; she felt a woman's presence in the air.</p>

<p>One morning, as she went down the street rather
earlier than usual, she spied him a few yards before her
on the sidewalk. He was dressed up, and constantly
looked himself over as he walked along. From time to
time he raised his trouser leg a little to see the polish on
his boots. She followed him. He went straight on
without looking back. She was not far behind him
when he reached Place Bréda. There was a woman
walking on the square beside the cabstand. Germinie
could see nothing of her but her back. Jupillon went
up to her and she turned: it was his cousin. They
began to walk side by side, up and down the square;
then they started through Rue Bréda toward Rue de
Navarin. There the girl took Jupillon's arm; she did
not lean on it at first, but little by little, as they proceeded,
she leaned toward him, with the movement of
a branch when it is bent, and drew closer and closer.
They walked slowly, so slowly that at times Germinie
was obliged to stop in order to keep at a safe distance
from them. They ascended Rue des Martyrs, passed
through Rue de la Tour d'Auvergne, and went down
Rue Montholon. Jupillon was talking earnestly; the
cousin said nothing, but listened to Jupillon, and walked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
on with the absent-minded air of a woman smelling of a
bouquet, now and then darting a little vague glance on
one side or the other&mdash;the glance of a frightened child.</p>

<p>When they reached Rue Lamartine, opposite the
Passage des Deux-S&oelig;urs, they turned. Germinie had
barely time to throw herself in at a hall door. They
passed without seeing her. The little one was very serious
and walked slowly. Jupillon was talking into her ear.
They stopped for a moment; Jupillon gesticulated earnestly;
the girl stared fixedly at the pavement. Germinie
thought they were about to part; but they resumed
their walk together and made four or five turns,
passing back and forth by the end of the passage. At
last they turned in; Germinie darted from her hiding-place
and rushed after them. From the gateway of the
passage she saw the skirt of a dress disappear through
the door of a small furnished lodging-house, beside a
wine shop. She ran to the door, looked into the hall
and could see nothing. Thereupon all her blood rushed
to her head, with one thought, a single thought that her
lips kept repeating like an idiot: "Vitriol! vitriol!
vitriol!" And as her thoughts were instantly transformed
into the act of which she thought, and her
delirium transported her abruptly to the crime she contemplated,
she said to herself that she would go up the
stairs with the bottle well hidden under her shawl; she
would knock at the door very loud and continuously.
He would come at last and would open the door a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
crack. She would say nothing to him, not her name
even. She would go in without heeding him. She was
strong enough to kill him! and she would go to the
bed, to <i>her</i>! She would take her by the arm and say:
"Yes it's me&mdash;this is for your life!" And over her
face, her throat, her skin, over everything about her
that was youthful and attractive and that invited love,
Germinie watched the vitriol sear and seam and burn
and hiss, transforming her into a horrible object that
filled Germinie's heart to overflowing with joy! The
bottle was empty, and she laughed! And, in her
frightful dream, her body also dreaming, her feet began
to move. She walked unconsciously down the passage,
into the street and to a grocer's shop. Ten minutes she
stood motionless at the counter, with eyes that did not
see, the vacant, wandering eyes of one who has murder
in his heart.</p>

<p>"Well, well, what do you want?" said the grocer's
wife testily, almost frightened by the bearing of this
woman who did not stir.</p>

<p>"What do I want?" said Germinie. She was so
filled, so possessed with the thought of what she wanted
that she believed she had asked for vitriol. "What do
I want?"&mdash;She passed her hand across her forehead.&mdash;"Ah!
I don't know now."</p>

<p>And she left the shop, stumbling as she went.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>




<hr />
<h2 class="chapter">XXXIII</h2>


<p>In the torment of the life she was leading, in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
she suffered the horrors of death and of unsatisfied passion,
Germinie, seeking to deaden her ghastly thoughts,
had remembered the glass she had taken from Adèle's
hand one morning, which gave her a whole day of
oblivion. From that day she had taken to drink. She
had begun with the little morning draughts to which the
maids of kept women are addicted. She had drunk
with this one and with that one. She had drunk with
men who came to breakfast at the creamery; she had
drunk with Adèle, who drank like a man and who took
a base delight in seeing this virtuous woman's maid
descend as low as herself.</p>

<p>At first she had needed excitement, company, the
clinking of glasses, the encouragement of speech, the
inspiration of the challenge, in order to arouse the
desire to drink; but she had soon reached the point
where she drank alone. Then it was that she began to
carry home a half-filled glass under her apron and hide
it in a corner of the kitchen; that she had taken to
drinking those mixtures of white wine and brandy, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
which she would take draught upon draught until she
had found that for which she thirsted&mdash;sleep. For what
she craved was not the fevered brain, the happy confusion,
the living folly, the delirious, waking dream of
drunkenness; what she needed, what she sought was the
negative joy of sleep, Lethean, dreamless sleep, a leaden
sleep falling upon her like the blow of the sledge
upon the ox's head: and she found it in those compounds
which struck her down and stretched her out
face downward on the waxed cover of the kitchen
table.</p>

<p>To sleep that overpowering sleep, to wallow, by day,
in that midnight darkness, had come to mean to her a
truce, deliverance from an existence that she had not the
courage to continue or to end. An overwhelming longing
for oblivion was all she felt when she awoke. The
hours of her life that she passed in possession of her
faculties, contemplating herself, examining her conscience,
looking on at her own shame, seemed to her so
execrable! She preferred to kill them. There was
nothing in the world but sleep to make her forget everything&mdash;the
congested sleep of intoxication, which lulls
its victim with the arms of Death.</p>

<p>In that glass, from which she forced herself to drink,
and which she emptied in a sort of frenzy, her sufferings,
her sorrows, all her horrible present would be
drowned and disappear. In a half hour, her mind
would have ceased to think, her life would have ceased<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
to exist; nothing of her surroundings would have any
being for her, there would be no more time even, so far
as she was concerned. "I drink away my troubles!"
she said to a woman who told her that she would wreck
her health by drinking. And as, in the periods of reaction
that followed her debauches, there came to her a
more painful feeling of her own shame, a greater sense
of desolation and a fiercer detestation of her mistakes
and her sins, she sought stronger decoctions of alcohol,
more fiery brandy, and even drank pure absinthe, in
order to produce a more deathly lethargy, and to make
her more utterly oblivious to everything.</p>

<p>She ended by attaining in this way whole half days
of unconsciousness, from which she emerged only half
awake, with benumbed intelligence, blunted perceptions,
hands that did things by force of habit, the
motions of a somnambulist, a body and a mind in which
thought, will, memory seemed still to retain the drowsiness
and vagueness of the confused waking hours of the
morning.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span></p>




<hr />
<h2 class="chapter">XXXIV</h2>


<p>Half an hour after the horrible meeting when&mdash;her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
mind having dabbled in crime as if with her fingers&mdash;she
had determined to disfigure her rival with vitriol and
had believed that she had done so, Germinie returned
to Rue de Laval with a bottle of brandy procured at
the grocer's.</p>

<p>For two weeks she had been mistress of the apartment,
free to indulge her brutish appetite. Mademoiselle
de Varandeuil, who as a general rule hardly stirred from
her chair, had gone, strangely enough, to pass six weeks
with an old friend in the country; and she decided not
to take Germinie with her for fear of setting a bad
example to the other servants, and arousing their jealousy
of a maid who was accustomed to very light duties
and was treated on a different footing from themselves.</p>

<p>Germinie went into mademoiselle's bedroom and
took no more time than was necessary to throw her
shawl and hat on the floor before she began to drink,
with the neck of the bottle between her teeth, pouring
down the liquid hurriedly until everything in the room
was whirling around her, and she remembered nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
of the day. Thereupon, staggering, feeling that she
was about to fall, she tried to throw herself on her mistress's
bed to sleep; but her dizziness threw her against
the night table. From that she fell to the floor and lay
without moving; she simply snored. But the blow was
so violent that during the night she had a miscarriage,
followed by one of those hemorrhages in which the life
often ebbs away. She tried to rise and go out on the
landing to call; she tried to stand up: she could not.
She felt that she was gliding on to death, entering its
portals and descending with gentle moderation. At
last, summoning all her strength for a final effort, she
dragged herself as far as the hall door; but it was
impossible for her to lift her head to the keyhole,
impossible to cry out. And she would have died where
she lay had not Adèle, as she was passing in the morning,
heard a groan, and, in her alarm, fetched a locksmith
to open the door, and afterward a midwife to
attend to the dying woman.</p>

<p>When mademoiselle returned a month later, she
found Germinie up and about, but so weak that she was
constantly obliged to sit down, and so pale that she
seemed to have no blood left in her body. They told
her that she had had a hemorrhage of which she nearly
died: mademoiselle suspected nothing.</p>



<hr />
<h2 class="chapter">XXXV</h2>


<p>Germinie welcomed mademoiselle's return with melting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
caresses, wet with tears. Her affectionate manner
was like a sick child's; she had the same clinging gentleness,
the imploring expression, the melancholy of
timid, frightened suffering. She sought excuses for
touching her mistress with her white blue-veined hands.
She approached her with a sort of trembling and fervent
humility. Very often, as she sat facing her upon a stool,
and looked up at her with eyes like a dog's, she would
rise and go and kiss some part of her dress, then resume
her seat, and in a moment begin again.</p>

<p>There was heart-rending entreaty in these caresses,
these kisses of Germinie's. Death, whose footsteps she
had heard approaching her as if it were a living person;
the hours of utter prostration, when, as she lay in her
bed, alone with herself, she had reviewed her whole
past life; the consciousness of the shame of all she had
concealed from Mademoiselle de Varandeuil; the fear of
a judgment of God, rising from the depths of her former
religious ideas; all the reproaches, all the apprehensions
that whisper in the ear of a dying agony had aroused a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
horrible dread in her conscience; and remorse,&mdash;the
remorse that she had never been able to put down,&mdash;was
now alive and crying aloud in her enfeebled, broken
body, as yet but partially restored to life, as yet scarcely
firm in the persuasion that it was alive.</p>

<p>Germinie's was not one of those fortunate natures
that do wrong and leave the memory of it behind them,
and never feel a twinge of regret. She had not, like
Adèle, one of those vulgar material organizations,
which never allow themselves to be affected by any but
animal impulses. She was not blessed with one of those
consciences which escape suffering by virtue of mere
brutishness, or of that dense stupidity in which a
woman vegetates, sinning because she knows no better.
In her case, an unhealthy sensitiveness, a sort of cerebral
excitement, a disposition on the part of the brain
to be always on the alert, to work itself into a frenzy of
bitterness, anxiety and discontent with itself, a moral
sense that stood erect, as it were, after every one of her
backslidings, all the characteristics of a sensitive mind,
predestined to misfortune, united to torture her, and to
renew day after day, more openly and more cruelly in
her despair, the agony due to acts that would hardly
have caused such long-continued suffering in many
women in her station.</p>

<p>Germinie yielded to the impulse of passion; but as soon
as she had yielded to it she despised herself. Even in
the excitement of pleasure she could not entirely forget<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
and lose herself. The image of mademoiselle always
arose before her, with her stern, motherly face. Germinie
did not become immodest in the same degree that
she abandoned herself to her passions and sank lower
and lower in vice. The degrading depths to which
she descended did not fortify her against her disgust and
horror of herself. Habit did not harden her. Her
defiled conscience rejected its defilement, struggled
fiercely in its shame, rent itself in its repentance and did
not for one second permit itself the full enjoyment of
vice, was never completely stunned by its fall.</p>

<p>And so when mademoiselle, forgetting that she was a
servant, leaned over to her with the brusque familiarity
of tone and gesture that went straight to her heart,
Germinie, confused and overcome with blushing timidity,
was speechless and seemed bereft of sense under the
horrible torture caused by the consciousness of her own
unworthiness. She would fly from the room, she would
invent some pretext to escape from that affection which
she so shamefully betrayed, and which, when it touched
her, stirred her remorse to shuddering activity.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>




<hr />
<h2 class="chapter">XXXVI</h2>


<p>The miraculous part of this disorderly, abandoned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
life, this life of shame and misery, was that it did not
become known. Germinie allowed no trace of anything
to appear outside; she allowed nothing to rise to
her lips, nothing to be seen in her face, nothing to be
noticed in her manner, and the accursed background of
her existence remained hidden from her mistress.</p>

<p>It had, indeed, sometimes occurred to mademoiselle
in a vague way that her maid had some secret, something
that she was concealing from her, something that
was obscure in her life. She had had moments of
doubt, of suspicion, an instinctive feeling of uneasiness,
confused glimpses of something wrong, a faint scent
that eluded her and vanished in the gloom. She had
thought at times that she had stumbled upon sealed,
unresponsive recesses in the girl's heart, upon a mystery,
upon some unlighted passage of her life. Again, at
times it had seemed to her that her maid's eyes did not
say what her mouth said. Involuntarily, she had remembered
a phrase that Germinie often repeated: "A
sin hidden, a sin half forgiven." But the thing that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
filled her thoughts above all else was amazement that
Germinie, despite the increase in her wages and the
little gifts that she gave her almost every day, never
purchased anything for her toilet, had no new dresses or
linen. Where did her money go? She had almost
admitted having withdrawn her eighteen hundred francs
from the savings bank. Mademoiselle ruminated over
it, then said to herself that that was the whole of her
maid's mystery; it was about money, she was short of
funds, doubtless on account of some obligations she had
entered into long ago for her family, and perhaps she
had been sending more money to "her <i>canaille</i> of a
brother-in-law." She was so kind-hearted and had so
little system! She had so little idea of the value of a
hundred-sou piece! That was all there was to it:
mademoiselle was sure of it; and as she knew the girl's
obstinate nature and had no hope of inducing her to
change her mind, she said nothing to her. If this explanation
did not fully satisfy mademoiselle, she attributed
what there was strange and mysterious in her maid's
behavior to her somewhat secretive nature, which retained
something of the characteristic distrust of the
peasant, who is jealous of her own petty affairs and
takes delight in burying a corner of her life away down
in her heart, as the villager hoards his sous in a woolen
stocking. Or else she persuaded herself that it was her
ill health, her state of continual suffering that was
responsible for her whims and her habit of dissimulation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
And her mind, in its interested search for motives,
stopped at that point, with the indolence and a little of
the selfishness of old people's minds, who, having an
instinctive dread of final results and of the real characters
of their acquaintances, prefer not to be too inquisitive
or to know too much. Who knows? Perhaps all
this mystery was nothing but a paltry matter, unworthy
to disturb or to interest her, some petty woman's quarrel.
She went to sleep thereupon, reassured, and ceased
to cudgel her brains.</p>

<p>In truth, how could mademoiselle have guessed Germinie's
degradation and the horror of her secret! In
her most poignant suffering, in her wildest intoxication,
the unhappy creature retained the incredible strength
necessary to suppress and keep back everything. From
her passionate, overcharged nature, which found relief
so naturally in expansion, never a word escaped or a
syllable that cast a ray of light upon her secret. Mortification,
contempt, disappointment, self-sacrifice, the
death of her child, the treachery of her lover, the dying
agony of her love, all remained voiceless within her, as
if she stifled their cries by pressing her hands upon her
heart. Her rare attacks of weakness, when she seemed
to be struggling with pains that strangled her, the fierce,
feverish caresses lavished upon Mademoiselle de Varandeuil,
the sudden paroxysms, as if she were trying to
give birth to something, always ended without words
and found relief in tears.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>Even illness, with its resulting weakness and enervation,
forced nothing from her. It could make no
impression on that heroic resolution to keep silent to the
end. Hysterical attacks extorted shrieks from her and
nothing but shrieks. When she was a girl she dreamed
aloud; she forced her dreams to cease speaking, she
closed the lips of her sleep. As mademoiselle might
have discovered from her breath that she had been drinking,
she ate shallots and garlic, and concealed the fumes
of liquor with their offensive odors. She even trained
her intoxication, her drunken torpor to awake at her
mistress's footstep, and remain awake in her presence.</p>

<p>Thus she led, as it were, two lives. She was like two
women, and by dint of energy, adroitness and feminine
diplomacy, with a self-assurance that never failed her
even in the mental confusion caused by drink, she succeeded
in separating those two existences, in living them
both without mingling them, in never allowing the two
women that lived in her to be confounded with each
other, in continuing to be, with Mademoiselle de Varandeuil,
the virtuous, respectable girl she had been, in
emerging from her orgies without carrying away the
taste of them, in displaying, when she left her lover, a
sort of old-maidish modesty, shocked by the scandalous
courses of other maids. She never uttered a word or
bore herself in a way to arouse a suspicion of her clandestine
life; nothing about her conveyed a hint as to
the way her nights were passed. When she placed her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
foot upon the door-mat outside Mademoiselle de Varandeuil's
apartments, when she approached her, when she
stood before her, she adopted the tone and the attitude,
even to a certain way of holding the dress, which relieve
a woman from so much as a suspicion of having aught
to do with men. She talked freely upon all subjects, as
if she had nothing to blush for. She spoke with bitterness
of the misdoings and shame of others, as if she
were herself beyond reproach. She joked with her
mistress about love, in a jovial, unembarrassed, indifferent
tone; to hear her you would have thought she was
talking of an old acquaintance of whom she had lost
sight. And in the eyes of all those who saw her only
as Mademoiselle de Varandeuil did and at her home,
there was a certain atmosphere of chastity about her
thirty-five years, the odor of stern, unimpeachable virtue,
peculiar to middle-aged maid-servants and plain women.</p>

<p>And yet all this falsehood in the matter of appearances
was not hypocrisy in Germinie. It did not arise from
downright duplicity, from corrupt striving for effect: it
was her affection for mademoiselle that made her what
she was with her. She was determined at any price to
save her the grief of seeing her as she was, of going to
the bottom of her character. She deceived her solely
in order to retain her affection,&mdash;with a sort of respect;
and a feeling of veneration, almost of piety, stole into
the ghastly comedy she was playing, like the feeling a girl
has who lies to her mother in order not to rend her heart.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>




<hr />
<h2 class="chapter">XXXVII</h2>


<p>To lie! nothing was left for her but that. She felt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
that it was an impossibility to draw back from her present
position. She did not even entertain the idea of an
attempt to escape from it, it seemed such a hopeless task,
she was so cowardly, so crushed and degraded, and she
felt that she was still so firmly bound to that man by all
sorts of vile, degrading chains, even by the contempt
that he no longer tried to conceal from her!</p>

<p>Sometimes, as she reflected upon her plight, she was
dismayed. The simple ideas and terrors of the peasantry
recurred to her mind. And the superstitions of
her youth whispered to her that the man had cast a spell
upon her, that he had perhaps given her enchanted bread
to eat. Otherwise would she have been what she was?
Would she have felt, at the mere sight of him, that
thrill of emotion through her whole frame, that almost
brute-like sensation of the approach of a master?
Would she have felt her whole body, her mouth, her
arms, her loving and caressing gestures involuntarily go
out to him? Would she have belonged to him so absolutely?
Long and bitterly she dwelt upon all that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>
should have cured her, rescued her: the man's disdain,
his insults, the degrading concessions he had forced
from her; and she was compelled to admit that there
had been nothing too precious for her to sacrifice to
him, and that for him she had swallowed the things she
loathed most bitterly. She tried to imagine the degree
of degradation to which her love would refuse to descend,
and she could conceive of none. He could do
what he chose with her, insult her, beat her, and she
would remain under his heel! She could not think of
herself as not belonging to him. She could not think
of herself without him. To have that man to love was
necessary to her existence; she derived warmth from
him, she lived by him, she breathed him. There seemed
to be no parallel case to hers among the women of her
condition whom she knew. No one of her comrades
carried into a <i>liaison</i> the intensity, the bitterness, the
torture, the enjoyment of suffering that she found in
hers. No one of them carried into it that which was
killing her and which she could not dispense with.</p>

<p>To herself she appeared an extraordinary creature, of
an exceptional nature, with the temperament of animals
whom ill-treatment binds the closer to their masters.
There were days when she did not know herself, and
when she wondered if she were still the same woman.
As she went over in her mind all the base deeds to which
Jupillon had induced her to stoop, she could not believe
that it was really she who had submitted to it. Had she,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
violent and impulsive as she knew herself to be, boiling
over with fiery passions, rebellious and hotheaded, exhibited
such docility and resignation? She had repressed
her wrath, forced back the murderous thoughts that had
crowded to her brain so many times! She had always
obeyed, always possessed her soul in patience, always
hung her head! She had forced her nature, her instincts,
her pride, her vanity, and more than all else,
her jealousy, the fierce passions of her heart, to crawl at
that man's feet! For the sake of keeping him she had
stooped to share him, to allow him to have mistresses,
to receive him from the hands of others, to seek a part
of his cheek on which his cousin had not kissed him!
And now, after all these sacrifices, with which she had
wearied him, she retained her hold upon him by a still
more distasteful sacrifice: she drew him to her by gifts,
she opened her purse to him to induce him to keep appointments
with her, she purchased his good-humor by
gratifying his whims and his caprices; she paid this brute,
who haggled over the price of his kisses and demanded
<i>pourboires</i> of love! And she lived from day to day in
constant dread of what the miserable villain would
demand of her on the morrow.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></p>

<h2 class="chapter">XXXVIII</h2>


<p>"He must have twenty francs," Germinie mechanically<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
repeated the sentence to herself several times, but
her thoughts did not go beyond the words she uttered.
The walk and the climb up five flights of stairs had made
her dizzy. She fell in a sitting posture on the greasy
couch in the kitchen, hung her head, and laid her arms
on the table. Her ears were ringing. Her ideas went
and came in a disorderly throng, stifling one another in
her brain, and of them all but one remained, more and
more distinct and persistent: "He must have twenty
francs! twenty francs! twenty francs!" And she looked
as if she expected to find them somewhere there, in the
fireplace, in the waste-basket, under the stove. Then
she thought of the people who owed her, of a German
maid who had promised to repay her more than a year
before. She rose and tied her capstrings. She no
longer said: "He must have twenty francs;" she said:
"I will get them."</p>

<p>She went down to Adèle: "You haven't twenty
francs for a note that just came, have you? Mademoiselle
has gone out."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>

<p>"Nothing here," said Adèle; "I gave madame my
last twenty francs last night to get her supper. The jade
hasn't come back yet. Will you have thirty sous?"</p>

<p>She ran to the grocer's. It was Sunday, and three
o'clock in the afternoon: the grocer had closed his
shop.</p>

<p>There were a number of people at the fruitwoman's;
she asked for four sous' worth of herbs.</p>

<p>"I haven't any money," said she. She hoped that
the woman would say: "Do you want some?" Instead
of that, she said: "What an idea! as if I was afraid of
you!" There were other maids there, so she went out
without saying anything more.</p>

<p>"Is there anything for us?" she said to the concierge.
"Ah! by the way, my Pipelet, you don't happen to
have twenty francs about you, do you? it will save my
going way up-stairs again."</p>

<p>"Forty, if you want&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>She breathed freely. The concierge went to a desk
at the back of the lodge. "<i>Sapristi!</i> my wife has
taken the key. Why! how pale you are!"</p>

<p>"It isn't anything." And she rushed out into the
courtyard toward the door of the servant's staircase.</p>

<p>This is what she thought as she went up-stairs: "There
are people who find twenty-franc pieces. He needed
them to-day, he told me. Mademoiselle gave me my
money not five days ago, and I can't ask her. After all,
what are twenty francs more or less to her? The grocer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>
would surely have lent them to me. I had another
grocer on Rue Taitbout: he didn't close till evening
Sundays."</p>

<p>She was in front of her own door. She leaned over
the rail of the other staircase, looked to see if anyone
was coming up, entered her room, went straight to
mademoiselle's bedchamber, opened the window and
breathed long and hard with her elbows on the window-sill.
Sparrows hastened to her from the neighboring
chimneys, thinking that she was going to toss bread to
them. She closed the window and glanced at the top
of the commode&mdash;first at a vein of marble, then at a
little sandal-wood box, then at the key&mdash;a small steel
key left in the lock. Suddenly there was a ringing in
her ears; she thought that the bell rang. She ran and
opened the door: there was no one there. She returned
with the certainty that she was alone, went to the
kitchen for a cloth and began to rub a mahogany armchair,
turning her back to the commode; but she could
still see the box, she could see it lying open, she could
see the coins at the right where mademoiselle kept her
gold, the papers in which she wrapped it, a hundred
francs in each;&mdash;her twenty francs were there! She
closed her eyes as if the light dazzled them. She felt
a dizziness in her conscience; but immediately her whole
being rose in revolt against her, and it seemed to her
as if her heart in its indignation rose to her throat.
In an instant the honor of her whole life stood erect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
between her hand and that key. Her upright, unselfish,
devoted past, twenty years of resistance to the evil
counsels and the corruption of that foul quarter, twenty
years of scorn for theft, twenty years in which her pocket
had not held back a sou from her employers, twenty
years of indifference to gain, twenty years in which
temptation had never come near her, her long maintained
and natural virtue, mademoiselle's confidence in
her&mdash;all these things came to her mind in a single
instant. Her youthful years clung to her and took
possession of her. From her family, from the memory
of her parents, from the unsullied reputation of her
wretched name, from the dead from whom she was
descended, there arose a murmur as of guardian angels
hovering about her. For one second she was saved.</p>

<p>And then, insensibly, evil thoughts glided one by one
into her brain. She sought for subjects of bitterness,
for excuses for ingratitude to her mistress. She compared
with her own wages the wages of which the other
maids in the house boasted vaingloriously. She concluded
that mademoiselle was very fortunate to have her
in her service, and that she should have increased her
wages more since she had been with her.</p>

<p>"And then," she suddenly asked herself, "why does
she leave the key in her box?" And she began to
reflect thereupon that the money in the box was not
used for living expenses, but had been laid aside by
mademoiselle to buy a velvet dress for a goddaughter.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>&mdash;"Sleeping
money," she said to herself. She marshaled
her reasons with precipitation, as if to make it impossible
to discuss them. "And then, it's only for once.
She would lend them to me if I asked her. And I will
return them."</p>

<p>She put out her hand and turned the key. She
stopped; it seemed to her that the intense silence round
about was listening to her and looking at her. She
raised her eyes: the mirror threw back her face at her.
Before that face, her own, she was afraid; she recoiled
in terror and shame as if before the face of her crime:
it was a thief's head that she had upon her shoulders!</p>

<p>She fled into the corridor. Suddenly she turned
upon her heel, went straight to the box, turned the key,
put in her hand, fumbled under the hair trinkets and
souvenirs, felt in a roll of five louis and took out one
piece, closed the box and rushed into the kitchen. She
had the little coin in her hand and dared not look at it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span></p>




<hr />
<h2 class="chapter">XXXIX</h2>


<p>Then it was that Germinie's abasement and degradation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
began to be visible in her personal appearance, to make
her stupid and slovenly. A sort of drowsiness came
over her ideas. She was no longer keen and prompt
of apprehension. What she had read and what she had
learned seemed to escape her. Her memory, which
formerly retained everything, became confused and
unreliable. The sharp wit of the Parisian maid-servant
gradually vanished from her conversation, her retorts,
her laughter. Her face, once so animated, was no
longer lighted up by gleams of intelligence. In her
whole person you would have said that she had become
once more the stupid peasant girl that she was when she
came from her province, when she went to a stationer's
for gingerbread. She seemed not to understand. As
mademoiselle expressed it, she made faces like an idiot.
She was obliged to explain to her, to repeat two or three
times things that Germinie had always grasped on the
merest hint. She asked herself, when she saw how slow
and torpid she was, if somebody had not exchanged her
maid for another.&mdash;"Why, you're getting to be a perfect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
imbecile!" she would sometimes say to her testily.
She remembered the time when Germinie was so useful
about finding dates, writing an address on a card, telling
her what day they had put in the wood or broached
the cask of wine,&mdash;all of which were things that her
old brain could not remember. Now Germinie remembered
nothing. In the evening, when she went over
her accounts with mademoiselle, she could not think
what she had bought in the morning; she would say:
"Wait!" but she would simply pass her hand vaguely
across her brow; nothing would come to her mind.
Mademoiselle, to save her tired old eyes, had fallen into
the habit of having Germinie read the newspaper to
her; but she got to stumbling so and reading with so
little intelligence, that mademoiselle was compelled to
decline her services with thanks.</p>

<p>As her faculties failed, she abandoned and neglected
her body in a like degree. She gave no thought to her
dress, nor to cleanliness even. In her indifference she
retained nothing of a woman's natural solicitude touching
her personal appearance; she did not dress decently.
She wore dresses spotted with grease and torn under the
arms, aprons in rags, worn stockings in shoes that were
out at heel. She allowed the cooking, the smoke, the
coal, the wax, to soil her hands and face and simply
wiped them as she would after dusting. Formerly she
had had the one coquettish and luxurious instinct of
poor women, a love for clean linen. No one in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
house had fresher caps than she. Her simple little
collars were always of that snowy whiteness that lights
up the skin so prettily and makes the whole person
clean. Now she wore frayed, dirty caps which looked
as if she had slept in them. She went without ruffles,
her collar made a band of filth against the skin of her
neck, and you felt that she was less clean beneath than
above. An odor of poverty, rank and musty, arose
from her. Sometimes it was so strong that Mademoiselle
de Varandeuil could not refrain from saying to her:
"Go and change your clothes, my girl&mdash;you smell of
the poor!"</p>

<p>In the street she no longer looked as if she belonged
to any respectable person. She had not the appearance
of a virtuous woman's maid. She lost the aspect of a
servant who, by dint of displaying her self-esteem and
self-respect even in her garb, reflects in her person the
honor and the pride of her masters. From day to day
she sank nearer to the level of that abject, shameless
creature whose dress drags in the gutter&mdash;a dirty slattern.</p>

<p>As she neglected herself, so she neglected everything
about her. She kept nothing in order, she did no cleaning
or washing. She allowed dirt and disorder to make
their way into the apartments, to invade mademoiselle's
own sanctum, with whose neatness mademoiselle was
formerly so well pleased and so proud. The dust collected
there, the spiders spun their webs behind the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
frames, the mirrors were as if covered with a veil; the
marble mantels, the mahogany furniture, lost their
lustre; moths flew up from the carpets which were
never shaken, worms ensconced themselves where the
brush and broom no longer came to disturb them;
neglect spread a film of dust over all the sleeping,
neglected objects that were formerly awakened and
enlivened every morning by the maid's active hand. A
dozen times mademoiselle had tried to spur Germinie's
self-esteem to action; but thereupon, for a whole day,
there was such a frantic scrubbing, accompanied by
such gusts of ill-humor, that mademoiselle would take
an oath never to try again. One day, however, she
made bold to write Germinie's name with her finger in
the dust on her mirror; Germinie did not forgive her
for a week. At last mademoiselle became resigned.
She hardly ventured to remark mildly, when she saw
that her maid was in good humor: "Confess, Germinie,
that the dust is very well treated with us!"</p>

<p>To the wondering observations of the friends who
still came to see her and whom Germinie was forced to
admit, mademoiselle would reply, in a compassionate,
sympathetic tone: "Yes, it is filthy, I know! But
what can you expect? Germinie's sick, and I prefer
that she shouldn't kill herself." Sometimes, when Germinie
had gone out, she would venture to rub a cloth
over a commode or touch a frame with the duster, with
her gouty hands. She would do it hurriedly, afraid of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
being scolded, of having a scene, if the maid should
return and detect her.</p>

<p>Germinie did almost no work; she barely served
mademoiselle's meals. She had reduced her mistress's
breakfast and dinner to the simplest dishes, those which
she could cook most easily and quickly. She made her
bed without raising the mattress, <i>à l'Anglaise</i>. The
servant that she had been was not to be recognized in
her, did not exist in her, except on the days when mademoiselle
gave a small dinner party, the number of covers
being always considerable on account of the party of
children invited. On those days Germinie emerged, as
if by enchantment, from her indolence and apathy, and,
putting forth a sort of feverish strength, she recovered
all her former energy in face of her ovens and the
lengthened table. And mademoiselle was dumfounded
to see her, all by herself, declining assistance and capable
of anything, prepare in a few hours a dinner for
half a score of persons, serve it and clear the table afterwards,
with the nimble hands and all the quick dexterity
of her youth.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>




<hr />
<h2 class="chapter">XL</h2>


<p>"No&mdash;not this time, no," said Germinie, rising from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
the foot of Jupillon's bed where she was sitting.
"There's no way. Why, you know perfectly well that
I haven't a sou&mdash;anything you can call a sou! You've
seen the stockings I wear, haven't you?"</p>

<p>She lifted her skirt and showed him her stockings, all
full of holes and tied together with strings. "I haven't
a change of anything. Money? Why, I didn't even
have enough to give mademoiselle a few flowers on her
birthday. I bought her a bunch of violets for a sou!
Oh! yes, money, indeed! That last twenty francs&mdash;do
you know where I got them? I took them out of
mademoiselle's box! I've put them back. But that's
done with. I don't want any more of that kind of
thing. It will do for once. Where do you expect me
to get money now, just tell me that, will you? You
can't pawn your skin at the Mont-de-Piété&mdash;unless!&mdash;--But
as to doing anything of that sort again, never in
my life! Whatever else you choose, but no stealing!
I won't do it again. Oh! I know very well what you
will do. So much the worse!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well! have you worked yourself up enough?" said
Jupillon. "If you'd told me that about the twenty
francs, do you suppose I'd have taken it? I didn't
suppose you were as hard up as all that. I saw that you
went on as usual. I fancied it wouldn't put you out to
lend me a twenty-franc piece, and I'd have returned it
in a week or two with the others. But you don't say
anything? Oh! well, I'm done, I won't ask you for
any more. But that's no reason we should quarrel, as I
can see." And he added, with an indefinable glance at
Germinie: "Till Thursday, eh?"</p>

<p>"Till Thursday!" said Germinie, desperately. She
longed to throw herself into Jupillon's arms, to ask his
pardon for her poverty, to say to him: "You see, I
can't do it!"</p>

<p>She repeated: "Till Thursday!" and took her
leave.</p>

<p>When, on Thursday, she knocked at the door of
Jupillon's apartment on the ground floor, she thought
she heard a man's hurried step at the other end of the
room. The door opened; before her stood Jupillon's
cousin with her hair in a net, wearing a red jacket and
slippers, and with the costume and bearing of a woman
who is at home in a man's house. Her belongings were
tossed about here and there: Germinie saw them on the
chairs she had paid for.</p>

<p>"Whom does madame wish to see?" demanded the
cousin, impudently.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span></p>

<p>"Monsieur Jupillon?"</p>

<p>"He has gone out."</p>

<p>"I'll wait for him," said Germinie, and she attempted
to enter the other room.</p>

<p>"You'll wait at the porter's lodge then;" and the
cousin barred the way.</p>

<p>"When will he return?"</p>

<p>"When the hens have teeth," said the girl, seriously,
and shut the door in her face.</p>

<p>"Well! this is just what I expected of him," said
Germinie to herself, as she walked along the street.
The pavement seemed to give way beneath her trembling
legs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span></p>




<hr />
<h2 class="chapter">XLI</h2>


<p>When she returned that evening from a christening<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
dinner, which she had been unable to avoid attending,
mademoiselle heard talking in her room. She thought
that there was someone with Germinie, and, marveling
thereat, she opened the door. In the dim light shed by
an untrimmed, smoking candle she saw nothing at first;
but, upon looking more closely, she discovered her
maid lying in a heap at the foot of the bed.</p>

<p>Germinie was talking in her sleep. She was talking
with a strange accent that caused emotion, almost fear.
The vague solemnity of supernatural things, a breath
from regions beyond this life, arose in the room, with
those words of sleep, involuntary, fugitive words, palpitating,
half-spoken, as if a soul without a body were
wandering about a dead man's lips. The voice was slow
and deep, and had a far-off sound, with long pauses of
heavy breathing, and words breathed forth like sighs,
with now and then a vibrating, painful note that went
to the heart,&mdash;a voice laden with mystery and with the
nervous tremor of the darkness, in which the sleeper
seemed to be groping for souvenirs of the past and passing
her hand over faces. "Oh! she loved me dearly,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
mademoiselle heard her say. "And if he had not died
we should be very happy now, shouldn't we? No!
no! But it's done, worse luck, and I don't want to tell
of it."</p>

<p>The words were followed by a nervous contraction of
her features as if she sought to seize her secret on the
edge of her lips and force it back.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle, with something very like terror, leaned
over the poor, forlorn body, powerless to direct its own
acts, to which the past returned as a ghost returns to a
deserted house. She listened to the confessions that
were all ready to rush forth but were instinctively
checked, to the unconscious mind that spoke without
restraint, to the voice that did not hear itself. A sensation
of horror came over her: she felt as if she were
beside a dead body haunted by a dream.</p>

<p>After a pause of some duration, and what seemed to
be a sort of conflict between the things that were present
in her mind, Germinie apparently turned her attention
to the circumstances of her present life. The
words that escaped her, disjointed, incoherent words,
were, as far as mademoiselle could understand them,
addressed to some person by way of reproach. And as
she talked on, her language became as unrecognizable
as her voice, which had taken on the tone and accent of
the dreamer. It rose above the woman, above her
ordinary style, above her daily expressions. It was the
language of the people, purified and transfigured by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
passion. Germinie accentuated words according to
their orthography; she uttered them with all their eloquence.
The sentences came from her mouth with
their proper rhythm, their heart-rending pathos and
their tears, as from the mouth of an admirable actress.
There were bursts of tenderness, interlarded with
shrieks; then there were outbreaks of rebellion, fierce
bursts of passion, and the most extraordinary, biting,
implacable irony, always merging into a paroxysm of
nervous laughter that repeated the same result and prolonged
it from echo to echo. Mademoiselle was confounded,
stupefied, and listened as at the theatre.
Never had she heard disdain hurled down from so lofty
a height, contempt so tear itself to tatters and gush
forth in laughter, a woman's words express such a fierce
thirst for vengeance against a man. She ransacked her
memory: such play of feature, such intonations, such a
dramatic and heart-rending voice as that voice of a consumptive
coughing away her life, she could not remember
since the days of Mademoiselle Rachel.</p>

<p>At last Germinie awoke abruptly, her eyes filled with
the tears of her dream, and jumped down from the bed,
seeing that her mistress had returned. "Thanks," said
mademoiselle, "don't disturb yourself! Wallow about
on my bed all you please!"</p>

<p>"Oh! mademoiselle," said Germinie, "I wasn't
lying where you put your head. I have made it nice
and warm for your feet."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>

<p>"Indeed! Suppose you tell me what you've been
dreaming? There was a man in it&mdash;you were having a
dispute with him&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Dream?" said Germinie, "I don't remember."</p>

<p>She silently set about undressing her mistress, trying
to recall her dream. When she had put her in bed, she
said, drawing near to her: "Ah! mademoiselle, won't
you give me a fortnight, for once, to go home? I
remember now."</p>



<hr />
<h2 class="chapter">XLII</h2>


<p>Soon after this, mademoiselle was amazed to notice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span>
an entire change in her maid's manner and habits. Germinie
no longer had her sullen, savage moods, her outbreaks
of rebellion, her fits of muttering words expressive
of discontent. She suddenly threw off her indolence
and became once more an energetic worker. She
no longer passed hours in doing her marketing; she
seemed to avoid the street. She ceased to go out in the
evening; indeed, she hardly stirred from mademoiselle's
side, hovering about her and watching her from
the time she rose in the morning until she went to bed
at night, lavishing continuous, incessant, almost irritating
attentions upon her, never allowing her to rise or
even to put out her hand for anything, waiting upon her
and keeping watch of her as if she were a child. At
times mademoiselle was so worn out with her, so weary
of this constant fussing about her person, that she would
open her mouth to say: "Come, come! aren't you
almost ready to clear out!" But Germinie would look
up at her with a smile, a smile so sad and sweet that it
checked the impatient exclamation on the old maid's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
lips. And so she stayed on with her, going about with
a sort of fascinated, divinely stolid air, in the impassibility
of profound adoration, buried in almost idiotic
contemplation.</p>

<p>At that period all the poor girl's affection turned to
mademoiselle. Her voice, her gestures, her eyes, her
silence, her thoughts, went out to her mistress with the
fervor of expiation, with the contrition of a prayer, the
rapt intensity of a cult. She loved her with all the
loving violence of her nature. She loved her with all
the deceptive ardor of her passion. She strove to give
her all that she had not given her, all that others had
taken from her. Every day her love clung more closely,
more devoutly, to the old maid, who was conscious of
being enveloped, embraced, agreeably warmed by the
heat from those two arms that were thrown about her
old age.</p>



<hr />
<h2 class="chapter">XLIII</h2>


<p>But the past and its debts were still there, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
whispered to her every hour: "If mademoiselle knew!"</p>

<p>She lived in the constant panic of a guilty woman,
trembling with dread from morning till night. There
was never a ring at the door that she did not say to
herself: "It has come at last!" Letters in a strange
handwriting filled her with anxiety. She would feel
of the wax with her fingers, bury the letters in her
pocket, hesitate about delivering them, and the moment
when mademoiselle unfolded the terrible paper and
scanned its contents with the inexpressive eye of elderly
people was as full of suspense to her as if she were
awaiting sentence of death. She felt that her secret and
her falsehood were in everybody's hand. The house
had seen her and might speak. The quarter knew her
as she was. Of all about her, there was no one but her
mistress whose esteem she could still steal.</p>

<p>As she went in and out, the concierge looked at her
with a smile and a glance, that said: "I know." She
no longer dared to call him: "My Pipelet." When she
returned home he looked into her basket. "I am so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
fond of that!" his wife would say, when it contained
some tempting morsel. At night she would take down
what was left. She ate nothing herself. She ended by
supplying them with food.</p>

<p>The whole street frightened her no less than the hall
and the porter's lodge. There was a face in every shop
that reflected her shame and commented on her sins. At
every step she had to purchase silence by groveling
humility. The dealers she had not been able to repay had
her in their clutches. If she said that anything was
too dear, she was reminded in a bantering way that they
were her masters, and that she must pay the price unless
she chose to be denounced. A jest or an allusion
drove the color from her cheeks. She was bound to
them, compelled to trade with them and to allow them
to empty her pockets as if they were accomplices. The
successor of Madame Jupillon, who had gone into the
grocery business at Bar-sur Aube,&mdash;the new <i>crémière</i>,&mdash;gave
her bad milk, and when she suggested that mademoiselle
complained about it, and that she was found
fault with every morning, the woman replied: "Much
you care for your mademoiselle!" And at the fish-stall,
if she smelt of a fish, and said: "This has been frozen,"
the reply would be: "Bah! tell me next, will you, that
I let the moon shine on their gills, so's to make 'em
look fresh! So these are hard days for you, eh, my
duck?" Mademoiselle wanted her to go to the <i>Halle
Centrale</i> one day for her dinner, and she mentioned the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
fact in the fish-woman's presence. "Oho! yes, yes, to
the <i>Halle</i>! I'd like to see you go to the <i>Halle</i>!" And
she bestowed a glance upon her in which Germinie saw
a threat to send her account to her mistress. The grocer
sold her coffee that smelt of snuff, rotten prunes, dried
rice and old biscuit. If she ventured to remonstrate,
"Nonsense!" he would say; "an old customer like you
wouldn't want to make trouble for me. Don't I tell you
I give you good weight?" And he would coolly give
her false weight of the goods that she ordered, and that
he forced her to order.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span></p>

<h2 class="chapter">XLIV</h2>


<p>It was a very great trial to Germinie&mdash;a trial that she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
sought, however&mdash;to have to pass through a street where
there was a school for young girls, when she went out
before dinner to buy an evening paper for mademoiselle.
She often happened to be at the door when the school
was dismissed; she tried to run away&mdash;and stood still.</p>

<p>At first there would be a sound like that made by a
swarm of bees, a buzzing and humming, one of those
great outbursts of childish joy that wake the echoes in the
streets of Paris. From the dark and narrow passageway
leading to the schoolroom the children would rush forth
as if escaping from an open cage, and run about and
frolic in the sunlight. They would push and jostle one
another, and toss their empty baskets in the air. Then
some would call to one another and form little groups;
tiny hands would go forth to meet other tiny hands;
friends would take one another by the arm or put their
arms around one another's waists or necks, and walk
along nibbling at the same tart. Soon the whole band
would be in motion, walking slowly up the filthy street
with loitering step. The larger ones, ten years old at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
most, would stop and talk, like little women, at the
<i>portes cochères</i>. Others would stop to drink from their
luncheon bottles. The smaller ones would amuse themselves
by dipping the soles of their shoes in the gutter.
And there were some who made a headdress of a cabbage
leaf picked up from the ground,&mdash;a green cap sent
by the good God, beneath which the fresh young face
smiled brightly.</p>

<p>Germinie would gaze at them all and walk along with
them; she would go in among them in order to feel the
rustling of their aprons. She could not take her eyes off
the little arms under which the school satchels leaped
about, the little pea-green dresses, the little black leggings,
the little legs in the little woolen stockings. In
her eyes there was a sort of divine light about all those
little flaxen heads, with the soft hair of the child Jesus.
A little stray lock upon a little neck, a bit of baby flesh
above a chemise or at the end of a sleeve&mdash;at times
she saw nothing but that; it was to her all the sunshine
of the street&mdash;and the sky!</p>

<p>Gradually the troop dwindled away. Each street
took some children away to neighboring streets. The
school dispersed along the road. The gaiety of all the
tiny footsteps died away little by little. The little
dresses disappeared one by one. Germinie followed the
last, she attached herself to those who went the farthest.</p>

<p>On one occasion, as she was walking along thus,
devouring with her eyes the memory of her daughter,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
she was suddenly seized with a frenzied longing to
embrace something; she rushed at one of the little girls
and grasped her arm just as a kidnapper of children
would do. "Mamma! mamma!" the little one cried,
and wept as she pulled her arm away.</p>

<p>Germinie fled.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span></p>




<hr />
<h2 class="chapter">XLV</h2>


<p>To Germinie all days were alike, equally gloomy and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
desolate. She had reached a point at last where she
expected nothing from chance and asked nothing from
the unforeseen. Her life seemed to her to be forever
encaged in her despair; it would always be the same
implacable thing, the same straight, monotonous road
to misfortune, the same dark path with death at the end.
In all the time to come there was no future for her.</p>

<p>And yet, in the depths of despair in which she was
crouching, thoughts passed through her mind at times
which made her raise her head and look before her to a
point beyond the present. At times the illusion of a
last hope smiled upon her. It seemed to her that she
might even yet be happy, and that if certain things
should come to pass, she would be. Thereupon she
imagined that those things did happen. She arranged
incidents and catastrophes. She linked the impossible
to the impossible. She reconstructed the opportunities
of her life. And her fevered hope, setting about the
task of creating events according to her desire on the
horizon of the future, soon became intoxicated with the
insane vision of her suppositions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span></p>

<p>Then the delirious hope would gradually fade away.
She would tell herself that it was impossible, that nothing
of what she dreamed of could happen, and she
would sink back in her chair and think. After a
moment or two she would rise and walk, slowly and
uncertainly, to the fireplace, toy with the coffee-pot on
the mantelpiece, and at last decide to take it: she
would learn what the rest of her life was to be. Her
good fortune, her ill fortune, everything that was to
happen to her was there, in that fortune-telling device
of the woman of the people, on the plate on which she
was about to pour the coffee-grounds. She drained the
water from the grounds, waited a few minutes, breathed
upon them with the religious breath with which her lips,
as a child, touched the paten at the village church.
Then she leaned over them, with her head thrust forward,
terrifying in her immobility, with her eyes fixed
intently upon the black dust scattered in patches over
the plate. She sought what she had seen fortune-tellers
find in the granulations and the almost imperceptible
traces left by the coffee as it trickled away. She fatigued
her eyes by gazing at the innumerable little spots, and
deciphered shapes and letters and signs therein. She
put aside some grains with her finger in order to see
them more clearly and more sharply defined. She
turned the plate slowly in her hands, this way and that,
questioned its mystery on all sides, and hunted down,
within its circular rim, apparitions, images, rudiments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
of names, shadowy initials, resemblances to different
people, rough outlines of objects, omens in embryo,
symbols of trifles, which told her that she would be
<i>victorious</i>. She wanted to see these things and she
compelled herself to discover them. Under her tense
gaze the porcelain became alive with the visions of her
insomnia; her disappointments, her hatreds, the faces
she detested, arose gradually from the magic plate and
the designs drawn thereon by chance. By her side the
candle, which she forgot to snuff, gave forth an intermittent,
dying light: it sank lower and lower in the
silence, night came on apace, and Germinie, as if turned
to stone in her agony, always remained rooted there,
alone and face to face with her fear of the future, trying
to decipher in the dregs of the coffee the confused features
of her destiny, until she thought she could detect
a cross, beside a woman who resembled Jupillon's cousin&mdash;a
cross, that is to say, <i>a speedy death</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span></p>




<hr />
<h2 class="chapter">XLVI</h2>


<p>The love which she lacked, and which it was her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
determination to deny herself, became the torment of
her life, incessant, abominable torture. She had to
defend herself against the fevers of her body and the
irritations from without, against the easily aroused
emotions and the indolent cowardice of her flesh,
against all the solicitations of nature by which she was
assailed. She had to contend with the heat of the day,
with the suggestions of the darkness, with the moist
warmth of stormy weather, with the breath of her past
and her memories, with the pictures suddenly thrown
upon the background of her mind, with the voices that
whispered caressingly in her ear, with the emotions that
sent a thrill of tenderness into her every limb.</p>

<p>Weeks, months, years, the frightful temptation endured,
and she did not yield or take another lover.
Fearful of herself, she avoided man and fled from his
sight. She continued her domestic, unsocial habits,
always closeted with mademoiselle, or else above in her
own room. On Sundays she did not leave the house.
She had ceased to consort with the other maids in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
house, and, in order to occupy her time and forget herself,
she plunged into vast undertakings in the way of
sewing, or buried herself in sleep. When musicians
came into the courtyard she closed the windows in order
not to hear them: the sensuousness of music moved her
very soul.</p>

<p>In spite of everything, she could not calm or cool her
passions. Her evil thoughts rekindled themselves, lived
and flourished upon themselves. At every moment the
fixed idea of desire arose from her whole being, became
throughout her body the fierce torment that
knows no end, that delirium of the senses, obsession,&mdash;the
obsession that nothing can dispel and that constantly
returns, the shameless, implacable obsession,
swarming with images, the obsession that brings love
close to the woman's every sense, that touches with it
her closed eyes, forces it smoking into her brain and
pours it, hot as fire, into her arteries!</p>

<p>At length, the nervous exhaustion caused by these
constant assaults, the irritation of this painful continence,
began to disturb Germinie's faculties. She
fancied that she could see her temptations: a ghastly
hallucination brought the realization of her dreams near
to her senses. It happened that at certain moments the
things she saw in her room, the candlesticks, the legs of
the chairs, everything about her assumed impure appearances
and shapes. Obscenity arose from everything
before her eyes and approached her. At such times she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
would look at her kitchen clock, and would say, like a
condemned man whose body no longer belongs to himself:
"In five minutes I am going down into the street."
And when the five minutes had passed she would stay
where she was.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span></p>




<hr />
<h2 class="chapter">XLVII</h2>


<p>The time came at last in this life of torture when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
Germinie abandoned the conflict. Her conscience
yielded, her will succumbed, she bowed her head beneath
her destiny. All that remained to her of resolution,
energy, courage, vanished before the feeling, the
despairing conviction, of her powerlessness to save herself
from herself. She felt that she was being borne
along on a resistless current, that it was useless, almost
impious, to try to stop. That great power of the world
that causes suffering, the malevolent power that bears
the name of a god on the marble of the antique tragedies,
and is called <i>No Chance</i> on the tattooed brow of the
galley-slave&mdash;Fatality&mdash;was trampling upon her, and
Germinie lowered her head beneath its foot.</p>

<p>When, in her hours of discouragement, the bitter
experiences of her past recurred to her memory, when
she followed, from her infancy, the links in the chain of
her deplorable existence, that long line of afflictions that
had followed her years and grown heavier with them;
all the incidents that had succeeded one another in her
life, as if by preconcerted arrangement on the part of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
misery, without her having ever caught a glimpse of the
hand of the Providence of which she had heard so
much&mdash;she said to herself that she was one of those
miserable creatures who are destined from their birth to
an eternity of misery, one of those for whom happiness
was not made, and who know it only because they envy
it in others. She fed and nourished herself on that
thought, and by dint of yielding to the despair it
tended to produce, by dint of brooding over the unbroken
chain of her misfortunes and the endless succession
of her disappointments, she reached the point
where she looked upon the most trifling annoyances of
her life and her service as a part of the persecution of
her evil genius. A little money that she loaned and
that was not repaid, a counterfeit coin that was put off
upon her in a shop, an errand that she failed to perform
satisfactorily, a purchase in which she was cheated&mdash;all
these things were in her opinion due neither to her own
fault nor to chance. It was the sequel of what had
gone before. Life was in a conspiracy against her and
persecuted her everywhere, in everything, great and
small, from her daughter's death to bad groceries.
There were days when she broke everything she touched;
she thereupon imagined that she was accursed to her
finger-tips. Accursed! almost damned; she persuaded
herself that she was so in very truth, when she questioned
her body, when she probed her feelings. Did
she not feel, in the fire in her blood, in the appetite of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
her organs, in her passionate weakness, the spur of the
Fatality of Love, the mystery and obsession of a disease,
stronger than her modesty and her reason, having
already delivered her over to the shameful excesses of
passion, and destined&mdash;she had a presentiment that it
was so&mdash;to deliver her again in the same way?</p>

<p>And so she had one sentence always in her mouth, a
sentence that was the refrain of her thought: "What
can you expect? I am unlucky. I have had no chance.
From the beginning nothing ever succeeded with me!"
She said it in the tone of a woman who has abandoned
hope. With the persuasion, every day more firm, that
she was born under an unlucky star, that she was in the
power of hatred and vengeance that were more powerful
than she, Germinie had come to be afraid of everything
that happens in ordinary life. She lived in that state of
cowardly unrest wherein the unexpected is dreaded as a
possible calamity, wherein a ring at the bell causes
alarm, wherein one turns a letter over and over, weighing
the mystery it contains, not daring to open it,
wherein the news you are about to hear, the mouth that
opens to speak to you, cause the perspiration to start
upon your temples. She was in that state of suspicion,
of shuddering fear, of trembling awe in face of destiny,
wherein misfortune sees naught but misfortune, and
wherein one would like to check the current of his
life so that it should not go forward whither all the
endeavors and the attacks of others are forcing it.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>

<p>At last, by virtue of the tears she shed, she arrived at
that supreme disdain, that climax of suffering, where the
excess of pain seems a satire, where chagrin, exceeding
the utmost limits of human strength, exceeds its sensibility
as well, and the stricken heart, which no longer
feels the blows, says to the Heaven it defies: "Go on!"</p>



<hr />
<h2 class="chapter">XLVIII</h2>


<p>"Where are you going in that rig?" said Germinie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
one Sunday morning to Adèle, as she passed in grand
array along the corridor on the sixth floor, in front of
her open door.</p>

<p>"Ah! there you are! I'm going to a swell wedding,
my dear! There's a crowd of us&mdash;big Marie, the <i>great
bully</i>, you know&mdash;Elisa, from 41, the two Badiniers, big
and little&mdash;and men, too! In the first place, there's
my <i>dealer in sudden death</i>. Yes, and&mdash;Oh! didn't
you know&mdash;my new flame, the master-at-arms of the
24th&mdash;and a friend of his, a painter, a real Father Joy.
We're going to Vincennes. Everyone carries something.
We shall dine on the grass&mdash;the men will pay
for the wine. And there'll be plenty of it, I promise
you!"</p>

<p>"I'll go, too," said Germinie.</p>

<p>"You? nonsense! you don't go to parties any more."</p>

<p>"But I tell you I'll go," said Germinie, in a sharp,
decided tone. "Just give me time to tell mademoiselle
and put on a dress. If you'll wait I'll go and get half
a lobster."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span></p>

<p>Half an hour later the two women left the house; they
skirted the city wall and found the rest of the party
sitting outside a café on Boulevard de la Chopinette.
After taking a glass of currant wine, they entered two
large cabs and rode away. When they arrived at the
fortress at Vincennes they alighted and the whole party
walked along the bank of the moat. As they were
passing under the wall of the fort, the master-at-arms'
friend, the painter, shouted to an artilleryman, who
was doing sentry duty beside a cannon: "Say! old
fellow, you'd rather drink one than stand guard over
it, eh?"<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>"Isn't he funny?" said Adèle to Germinie, nudging
her with her elbow.</p>

<p>Soon they were fairly in the forest of Vincennes.</p>

<p>Narrow paths crossed and recrossed in every direction
on the hard, uneven, footprint-covered ground. In the
spaces between all these little roads there was here and
there a little grass, but down-trodden, withered, yellow,
dead grass, strewn about like bedding for cattle, its
straw-colored blades were everywhere mingled with
briars, amid the dull green of nettles. It was easily
recognizable as one of the rural spots to which the great
faubourgs resort on Sundays to loll about in the grass,
and which resemble a lawn trampled by a crowd after a
display of fireworks. Gnarled, misshapen trees were
scattered here and there; dwarf elms with gray trunks
covered with yellow, leprous-like spots and stripped of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
branches to a point higher than a man's head; scraggy
oaks, eaten by caterpillars so that their leaves were like
lacework. The verdure was scant and sickly and entirely
unshaded, the leaves above had a very unhealthy look;
the stunted, ragged, parched foliage made only faint
green lines against the sky. Clouds of dust from the
high-roads covered the bushes with a gray pall. Everything
had the wretched, impoverished aspect of trampled
vegetation that has no chance to breathe, the melancholy
effect of the grass at the barriers! Nature seemed to
sprout from beneath the pavements. No birds sang in
the trees, no insects hummed about the dusty ground;
the noise of the spring-carts stunned the birds; the
hand-organ put the rustling of the trees to silence; the
denizens of the street strolled about through the paths,
singing. Women's hats, fastened with four pins to a
handkerchief, were hanging from the trees; the red
plume of an artilleryman burst upon one at every moment
through the scanty leaves; dealers in honey rose
from the thickets; on the trampled greensward children
in blouses were cutting twigs, workingmen's families
idling their time away nibbling at <i>pleasure</i>, and little
urchins catching butterflies in their caps. It was a
forest after the pattern of the original Bois de Boulogne,
hot and dusty, a much-frequented and sadly-abused
promenade, one of those spots, avaricious of shade, to
which the common people flock to disport themselves
at the gates of great capitals&mdash;burlesque forests, filled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
with corks, where you find slices of melon and skeletons
in the underbrush.</p>

<p>The heat on this day was stifling; the sun was swimming
in clouds, shedding a veiled diffuse light that was
almost blinding to the eyes and that seemed to portend
a storm. The air was heavy and dead; nothing stirred;
the leaves and their tiny, meagre shadows did not move;
the forest seemed weary and crushed, as it were, beneath
the heavy sky. At rare intervals a breath of air from
the south passed lazily along, sweeping the ground, one
of those enervating, lifeless winds that blow upon the
senses and fan the breath of desire into a flame. With
no knowledge whence it came, Germinie felt over her
whole body a sensation like the tickling of the down
on a ripe peach against the skin.</p>

<p>They went gayly along, with the somewhat excited
activity that the country air imparts to the common
people. The men ran, the women tripped after them
and caught them. They played at rolling on the grass.
There was a manifest longing to dance and climb trees;
the painter amused himself by throwing stones at the
loop-holes in the gateways of the fortress, and he never
missed his aim.</p>

<p>At last they all sat down in a sort of clearing under a
clump of oaks, whose shadows were lengthening in the
setting sun. The men, lighting matches on the seats
of their trousers, began to smoke. The women chattered
and laughed and threw themselves backward in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
paroxysms of inane hilarity and noisy outbursts of
delight. Germinie alone did not speak or laugh. She
did not listen or look. Her eyes, beneath their lowered
lids, were fixed upon the toes of her boots. So engrossed
in thought was she that you would have said she was
totally oblivious to time and place. Lying at full
length on the grass, her head slightly raised by a hammock,
she made no other movement than to lay her
hands, palm downwards, on the grass beside her; in a
short time she would turn them on their backs and let
them lie in that position, seeking the coolness of the
earth to allay the fever of her flesh.</p>

<p>"There's a lazybones! going to sleep?" said Adèle.</p>

<p>Germinie opened wide her blazing eyes, without
answering, and until dinner maintained the same position,
the same silence, the same air of torpor, feeling
about her for places where her burning hands had not
rested.</p>

<p>"Come, old girl!" said a woman's voice, "sing us
something."</p>

<p>"Oh! no," Adèle replied, "I haven't got wind
enough before eating."</p>

<p>Suddenly a great stone came hurtling through the air
and struck the ground near Germinie's head; at the
same moment she heard the painter's voice shouting:
"Don't be afraid! that's your chair."</p>

<p>One and all laid their handkerchiefs on the ground
by way of tablecloth. Eatables were produced from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
greasy papers. Bottles were uncorked and the wine
went round; the glasses were rested against tufts of grass,
and they fell to upon bits of pork and sausages, with
slices of bread for plates. The painter cut boats out of
paper to hold the salt, and imitated the orders shouted
out by waiters in a café. "<i>Boum! Pavillon! Servez!</i>"
he cried. The company gradually became animated.
The open air, the patches of blue sky, the food and
drink started the gayety of the table in full blast.
Hands approached one another, mouths met, coarse
remarks were whispered from one to another, shirt
sleeves crept around waists, and now and then energetic
embraces were attended by greedy, resounding kisses.</p>

<p>Germinie drank, and said nothing. The painter, who
had taken his place by her side, felt decidedly chilly
and embarrassed beside his extraordinary neighbor, who
amused herself "so entirely inside." Suddenly he
began to beat a tattoo with his knife against his glass,
drowning the uproar of the party, and rose to his knees.</p>

<p>"Mesdames!" said he, with the voice of a paroquet
that has sung too much, "here's the health of a man in
hard luck: myself! Perhaps it will bring me good
luck! Deserted, yes, mesdames; yes, I've been deserted!
I'm a widower! you know the kind of widower,
<i>razibus</i>! I was struck all of a heap. Not that I cared
much for her, but habit, that old villain, habit! The
fact is I'm as bored as a bed-bug in a watch spring. For
two weeks my life has been like a restaurant without a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
<i>pousse-café</i>! And when I love love as if it had made me!
No wife! That's what I call weaning a grown man!
that is to say, since I've known what it is, I take off my
hat to the curés: I feel very sorry for them, 'pon my
word! No wife! and there are so many of 'em! But I
can't walk about with a sign: <i>Vacant man to let. Inquire
within.</i> In the first place it would have to be
stamped by M'sieu le Préfet, and then, people are such
fools, it would draw a crowd! All of which, mesdames,
is intended to inform you, that if, among the people you
have the honor of knowing, there should happen to be
one who'd like to make an acquaintance&mdash;virtuous acquaintance&mdash;a
pretty little left-handed marriage&mdash;why
she needn't look any farther! I'm her man&mdash;Victor-Médéric
Gautruche! a home body, a genuine house-ivy
for sentiment! She has only to apply at my former
hotel, <i>La Clef de S&ucirc;reté</i>. And gay as a hunchback
who's just drowned his wife! Gautruche, called Gogo-la-Gaiété,
egad! A pretty fellow who knows what's
what, who doesn't beat about the bush, a good old body
who takes things easy and who won't give himself the
colic with that fishes' grog!" With that he took a bottle
of water that stood beside him and hurled it twenty
yards away. "Long live the walls! They're the same
to papa that the sky is to the good God! Gogo-la-Gaiété
paints them through the week and beats them on
Monday!<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> And with all that not jealous, not ugly, not
a wife-beater, but a real love of a man, who never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
harmed one of the fair sex in his life! If you want
physique, <i>parbleu</i>! I'm your man!"</p>

<p>He rose to his feet and, drawing up his wavering
body, clad in an old blue coat with gilt buttons, to its
full height, removing his gray hat so as to show his perspiring,
polished, bald skull, and tossing his old plucked
<i>gamin's</i> head, he continued: "You see what it is! It
isn't a very attractive piece of property; it doesn't help
it to exhibit it. But it yields well, it's a little dilapidated,
but well put together. Dame! Here I am with my
little forty nine-years&mdash;no more hair than a billiard ball,
a witchgrass beard that would make good herb-tea,
foundations not too solid, feet as long as La Villette&mdash;and
with all the rest thin enough to take a bath in a musket-barrel.
There's the bill of lading! Pass the prospectus
along! If any woman wants all that in a lump&mdash;any
respectable person&mdash;not too young&mdash;who won't amuse
herself by painting me too yellow&mdash;you understand, I
don't ask for a Princess of Batignolles&mdash;why, sure as
you're born, I'm her man!"</p>

<p>Germinie seized Gautruche's glass, half emptied it at a
draught and held out the side from which she had drunk
to him.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p>At nightfall the party returned on foot. When they
reached the fortifications, Gautruche drew a large heart
with the point of his knife on the stone, and all the
names with the date were carved inside.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span></p>

<p>In the evening Gautruche and Germinie were upon
the outer boulevards, near Barrière Rochechouart. Beside
a low house with these words, in a plaster panel:
<i>Madame Merlin</i>. <i>Dresses cut and tried on, two francs</i>,
they stopped at a stone staircase of three steps leading
into a dark passage, at the end of which shone the red
light of an Argand lamp. At the entrance to the passage,
these words were printed in black on a wooden
sign:</p>

<h2 class="chapter">XLIX</h2>


<p>Médérie Gautruche was one of the wenching, idling,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
vagabond workmen who make their whole life a Monday.
Filled with the love of wine, his lips forever wet
with the last drop, his insides as thoroughly lined with
tartar as an old wine cask, he was one of those whom the
Burgundians graphically call <i>boyaux rouges</i>.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Always a
little tipsy, tipsy from yesterday when he had drunk nothing
to-day, he looked at life through the sunbeam in his
head. He smiled at his fate, he yielded to it with the
easy indifference of the drunkard, smiling vaguely from
the steps of the wineshop at things in general, at life and
the road that stretched away into the darkness. <i>Ennui</i>,
care, want, had gained no hold upon him; and if by
chance a grave or gloomy thought did come into his
mind, he turned his head away, uttered an exclamation
that sounded like <i>psitt</i>! which was his way of saying
<i>pshaw</i>! and, raising his right arm, caricaturing the
gesture of a Spanish dancer, he would toss his melancholy
over his shoulder to the devil. He had the
superb after-drinking philosophy, the jovial serenity, of
the bottle. He knew neither envy nor longing. His<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
dreams served him as a cashbox. For three sous he was
sure of a small glass of happiness; for twelve, of a bottle
of ideal bliss. Being content with everything, he liked
everything, and found food for laughter and entertainment
in everything. Nothing in the world seemed sad
to him&mdash;except a glass of water.</p>

<p>With this drunkard's expansiveness, with the gayety
of his excellent health and his temperament, Gautruche
combined the characteristic gayety of his profession, the
good humor and the warm-heartedness of that free,
unfatiguing life, in the open air, between heaven and
earth, which seeks distraction in singing, and flings the
workmen's <i>blague</i> at passers-by, from its lofty perch
upon a ladder. He was a house-painter and did lettering.
He was the one man in Paris who would attack a
sign without a measure, with no other guide than a cord,
without outlining the letters in white; he was the only
one who could place each of the letters in position
inside of the frame of a placard, and, without losing an
instant in aligning them, dash off capitals off-hand. He
was also renowned for fantastic letters, capricious letters,
letters shaded in bronze or gold to imitate those cut in
stone. Thus he made fifteen to twenty francs on some
days. But as he drank it all up, he was not wealthy,
and he always had unpaid scores on the slate at the
wine-shops.</p>

<p>He was a man brought up in the street. The street
had been his mother, his nurse and his school. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
street had given him his self-assurance, his ready tongue
and his wit. All that the keen mind of a man of the
people can pick up upon the pavements of Paris he had
picked up. All that falls from the upper to the lower
strata of a great city, the strainings and drippings, the
crumbs of ideas and information, the things that float
in the sensitive atmosphere and the brimming gutters,
the contact with the covers of books, bits of <i>feuilletons</i>
swallowed between two glasses, odds and ends of plays
heard on the boulevard, had endowed him with that
accidental intelligence which, though without education,
learns everything. He possessed an inexhaustible, imperturbable
store of talk. His words gushed forth
abundantly in original remarks, laughable images, the
metaphors that flow from the comic genius of crowds.
He had the natural picturesqueness of the unadulterated
farce. He was brimming over with amusing stories and
buffoonery, rich in the possession of the richest of all
repertories of house-painter's nonsense. Being a member
of divers of the low haunts called <i>lists</i>, he knew all
the new tunes and ballads, and he was never tired of
singing. He was amusing, in short, from head to foot.
And if you merely looked at him you laughed at him,
as at a comic actor.</p>

<p>A man of his cheerful, hearty temperament suited
Germinie.</p>

<p>Germinie was not a mere beast of burden with nothing
but her work in her head. She was not the servant,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
who stands like a post, with the frightened face and
doltish air of utter stupidity, when masters and mistresses
are talking in her presence. She, too, had cast off her
shell, fashioned herself and opened her mind to the education
of Paris. Mademoiselle de Varandeuil, having
no occupation, and being interested after the manner
of old maids in what was going on in the quarter, had
long been in the habit of making Germinie tell her
what news she had gleaned, what she knew of the
tenants, all the gossip of the house and the street; and
this habit of narration, of talking with her mistress like
a sort of companion, of describing people and drawing
silhouettes of them, had eventually developed in her a
facility of animated description, of happy, unconscious
characterization, a piquancy and sometimes an acrimony
in her remarks that were most remarkable in the mouth
of a servant. She had progressed so far that she often
surprised Mademoiselle de Varandeuil by her quickness
of comprehension, her promptness at grasping things
only half said, her good fortune and facility in selecting
such words as good talkers use. She knew how to jest.
She understood a play upon words. She expressed herself
without <i>cuirs</i>,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> and when there was a discussion concerning
orthography at the creamery, her opinion was
listened to with as much deference as that of the clerk
in the registry of deaths at the mayoralty who came
there to breakfast. She had also that background of
indiscriminate reading which women of her class have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
when they read at all. With the two or three kept
women in whose service she had been, she had passed
her nights devouring novels; since then she had continued
to read the <i>feuilletons</i> cut by her acquaintances
from the bottom of newspapers, and she had gathered
from them a vague idea of many things and of some of
the kings of France. She had retained enough of such
subjects to make her desire to talk of them with others.
Through a woman in the house who worked for an
author on the street, she often had tickets to the play;
when she came away she could remember the whole
play and the names of the actors she had seen on the
programme. She loved to buy ballads and one sou
novels, and read them.</p>

<p>The air, the keen breath of Quartier Bréda, full of
the <i>verve</i> of the artist and the studio, of art and vice,
had sharpened these tastes of Germinie's mind and had
created in her new needs and demands. Long before
her disorderly life began, she had cut loose from the
virtuous companionship of decent women of her rank
and station, from the worthy creatures who were so
uninteresting and stupid. She had quitted the circle of
orderly, dull uprightness, of sleep-inducing conversations
around the tea-table under the auspices of the old
servants of mademoiselle's elderly acquaintances. She
had shunned the wearisome society of maids whom their
absorption in their employment and the fascination of
the savings bank rendered unendurably stupid. She had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
reached the point where, before accepting the companionship
of people, she must satisfy herself that they
possessed a degree of intelligence corresponding to her
own and were capable of understanding her. And now,
when she emerged from her fits of brutishness, when she
found her old self and was born again, in diversion and
pleasure, she must for her enjoyment have kindred
spirits of her own. She wanted men about her who
would make her laugh, noisy gayety, the spirituous wit
that intoxicated her with the wine that was poured into
her glass. And thus it was that she sank to the level of
the rascally Bohemia of the common people, uproarious,
maddening, intoxicating, like all Bohemias: thus it was
that she fell to the lot of a Gautruche.</p>



<hr />
<h2 class="chapter">L</h2>


<p>As Germinie was returning to the house one morning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
at daybreak, she heard, from the shadows of the <i>porte-cochère</i>
as it closed behind her, a voice cry: "Who's
that?" She ran to the servants' staircase, but found that
she was pursued, and as she turned a corner on the landing
the concierge seized her. As soon as he recognized
her, he said: "Oh! is it you? excuse me; don't be
frightened! What a giddy creature you are! It surprises
you to see me up so early, eh? It's on account
of the thieving that's going on these days in the cook's
bedroom on the second. Good-night to you! it's lucky
for you I don't tell all I know."</p>

<p>A few days later Germinie learned through Adèle that
the husband of the cook who had been robbed said that
there was no need to look very far; that the thief was in
the house, and that he knew what he knew. Adèle
added that it was making a good deal of talk in the
street and that there were plenty of people who would
believe it and repeat it. Germinie became very indignant
and told her mistress all about it. Mademoiselle
was even more indignant than she, and, feeling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
personally outraged by the insult, wrote instantly to the
cook's mistress that she must put a stop at once to the
slanderous statements concerning a girl who had been
in her service twenty years, and for whom she would
answer as for herself. The cook was reprimanded.
Her husband in his wrath talked louder than ever. He
made a great outcry and for several days filled the house
with his project of going to the commissioner of police
and calling upon him to question Germinie as to where
she procured the money to start the <i>crémière's</i> son in
business, as to where she procured the money to purchase
a substitute for him, and how she paid the expenses
of the men she kept. For a whole week the
terrible threat hung over Germinie's head. At last the
thief was discovered and the threat fell to the ground.
But it had had its effect on the poor girl. It had done
all the injury it could do in that confused brain, where,
under the sudden, overpowering rush of the blood, her
reason was wavering and became overcast at the slightest
shock. It had overturned that brain which was so
prompt to go astray in fear or vexation, which lost so
quickly the faculty of good judgment, of discernment,
clear-sightedness and appreciation of its surroundings,
which exaggerated its troubles, which plunged into
foolish alarms, previsions of evil, despairing presentiments,
which looked upon its terrors as realities, and
was constantly lost in the pessimism of that species of
delirium, at the end of which it could find nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
but this ejaculation and this phrase: "Bah! I will kill
myself!"</p>

<p>Throughout the week the fever in her brain caused her
to experience all the effects of the things she thought
might happen. By day and night she saw her shame
laid bare and made public; she saw her secret, her
cowardice, her wrong-doing, all that she carried about
with her concealed and sewn in her heart&mdash;she saw it
all uncovered, noised abroad, disclosed&mdash;disclosed to
mademoiselle! Her debts on Jupillon's account, augmented
by her debts for drink and for food for Gautruche,
by all that she purchased now on credit, her
debt to the concierge and the shopkeepers would soon
become known and ruin her! A cold shiver ran down
her back at the thought: she could feel mademoiselle
turning her away! Throughout the week she constantly
imagined herself standing before the commissioner
of police. Seven long days she brooded over
that word and that idea: the Law! the Law as it
appears to the imagination of the lower classes; something
terrible, indefinable, inevitable, which is everywhere,
and lurks in everyone's shadow; an omnipotent
source of calamity which appears vaguely in the judge's
black gown, between the police sergeant and the executioner,
with the hands of the gendarme and the arms of
the guillotine! She, who was subject to all the instinctive
terrors of the common people, and who often repeated
that she would much rather die than appear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
before the court&mdash;she imagined herself seated in the
dock, between two gendarmes, in a court-room, surrounded
by all the unfamiliar paraphernalia of the Law,
her ignorance of which made them objects of terror to
her. Throughout the week her ears heard footsteps on
the stairs coming to arrest her!</p>

<p>The shock was too violent for nerves as weak as hers.
The mental upheaval of that week of agony possessed
her with an idea that hitherto had only hovered about
her&mdash;the idea of suicide. She began to listen, with her
head in her hands, to the voice that spoke to her of
deliverance. She opened her ears to the sweet music of
death that we hear in the background of life like the fall
of mighty waters in the distance, dying away in space.
The temptations that speak to the discouraged heart of
the things that put an end to life so quickly and so
easily, of the means of quelling suffering with the hand,
pursued and solicited her. Her glance rested wistfully
upon all the things about her that could cure the disease
called life. She accustomed her fingers and her lips
to them. She touched them, handled them, drew them
near to her. She sought to test her courage upon them
and to obtain a foretaste of death. She would remain
for hours at her kitchen window with her eyes fixed on
the pavements in the courtyard down at the foot of the
five flights&mdash;pavements that she knew and could have
distinguished from others! As the daylight faded she
would lean farther out bending almost double over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
ill-secured window-bar, hoping always that it would give
way and drag her down with it&mdash;praying that she might
die without having to make the desperate, voluntary
leap into space to which she no longer felt equal.</p>

<p>"Why, you'll fall out!" said mademoiselle one day,
grasping her skirt impulsively in her alarm. "What
are you looking at down there in the courtyard?"</p>

<p>"Oh! nothing&mdash;the pavements."</p>

<p>"In Heaven's name, are you crazy? How you
frightened me!"</p>

<p>"Oh! people don't fall that way," said Germinie in
a strange tone. "I tell you, mademoiselle, in order to
fall one must have a mighty longing to do it!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span></p>




<hr />
<h2 class="chapter">LI</h2>


<p>Germinie had not been able to induce Gautruche,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
who was haunted by a former mistress, to give her the
key to his room. When he had not returned she was
obliged to await his coming outside, in the cold, dark
street.</p>

<p>At first she would walk back and forth in front of the
house. She would take twenty steps in one direction and
twenty in the other. Then, as if to prolong her period
of waiting, she would take a longer turn, and, going
farther and farther every time, would end by extending
her walk to both ends of the boulevard. Frequently
she walked thus for hours, shamefaced and mud-stained,
in the fog and darkness, amid the iniquitous and horrible
surroundings of an avenue near the barriers, where
darkness reigned. She followed the line of red-wine
shops, the naked arbors, the <i>cabaret</i> trellises supported
by dead trees such as we see in bear-pits, low, flat hovels
with curtainless windows cut at random in the walls, cap
factories where shirts are sold, and wicked-looking hotels
where a night's lodging may be had. She passed by
closed, hermetically-sealed shops, black with bankruptcy,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
by fragments of condemned walls, by dark passageways
with iron gratings, by walled-up windows, by doors that
seemed to give admission to those abodes of murder, the
plan of which is handed to the jury at the assizes. As
she went on, there were gloomy little gardens, crooked
buildings, architecture in its most degraded form, tall,
mouldy <i>portes-cochères</i>, hedge-rows, within which could
be vaguely seen the uncanny whiteness of stones in the
darkness, corners of unfinished buildings from which
arose the stench of nitrification, walls disfigured by disgusting
placards and fragments of torn advertisements
by which they were spotted with loathsome publications
as by leprosy. From time to time, at a sharp turn in
the street, she would come upon lanes that seemed to
plunge into dark holes a few steps from their beginning,
and from which a blast of damp air came forth as from
a cellar; dark no-thoroughfares stood out against the
sky with the rigidity of a great wall; streets stretched
vaguely away in the distance, with the feeble gleam of
a lantern twinkling here and there at long intervals
upon the ghostly plaster fronts of the houses.</p>

<p>Germinie would walk on and on. She would cover
all the territory where low debauchery fills its crop
on Mondays and finds its loves, between a hospital,
a slaughter-house, and a cemetery; Lariboisière, the
Abattoir and Montmartre.</p>

<p>The people who passed that way&mdash;the workman returning
from Paris whistling; the workingwoman, her day's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
work ended, hurrying on with her hands under her armpits
to keep herself warm; the street-walker in her black
cap&mdash;would stare at her as they passed. Strange men
acted as if they recognized her; the light made her
ashamed. She would turn and run toward the other
end of the boulevard and follow the dark, deserted footway
along the city wall; but she was soon driven away
by horrible shadows of men and by brutally familiar
hands.</p>

<p>She tried to go away; she insulted herself inwardly;
she called herself a cowardly wretch; she swore to herself
that each turn should be the last, that she would go
as far as a certain tree, and that was all; if he had not
returned, she would go away and put an end to the
whole thing. But she did not go; she walked on and
on; she waited, more consumed than ever, the longer
he delayed, with the mad desire to see him.</p>

<p>At last, as the hours flew by and the boulevard became
empty, Germinie, exhausted, overdone with weariness,
would approach the houses. She would loiter from shop
to shop, she would go mechanically where gas was still
burning, and stand stupidly in the bright glare from the
shop windows. She welcomed the dazzling light in her
eyes, she tried to allay her impatience by benumbing it.
The objects to be seen through the perspiring windows
of the wine-shops&mdash;the cooking utensils, the bowls of
punch flanked by two empty bottles with sprigs of laurel
protruding from their necks, the show-cases in which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
the liquors combined their varied colors in a single
beam, a cup filled with plated spoons&mdash;these things would
hold her attention for a long while. She would read
the old announcements of lottery drawings placarded
on the walls of a saloon, the advertisements of <i>gloria</i>&mdash;coffee
with brandy&mdash;the inscriptions in yellow letters:
<i>New wine, pure blood, 70 centimes.</i> For a whole quarter
of an hour she would stand staring into a back room
containing a man in a blouse sitting on a stool by a table,
a stove-pipe, a slate, and two black tea-boards against the
wall. Her fixed, vacant stare would rest, through the
reddish mist, upon the dark forms of shoemakers leaning
over their benches. It fell and lingered heedlessly
upon a counter that was being washed, upon hands that
were counting the receipts of the day, upon a tunnel
or jug that was being scoured with sandstone. She had
ceased to think. She would simply stand there, nailed
to the spot and growing weaker and weaker, feeling her
courage vanish from the mere weariness of standing on
her feet, seeing things only through a sort of film as in
a swoon, hearing the noise made by the muddy cabs
rolling over the wet pavements only as a buzzing in her
ears, ready to fall and compelled again and again to lean
against the wall for support.</p>

<p>In her then condition of prostration and illness, with
that semi-hallucination of vertigo that made her so timid
of crossing the Seine and impelled her to cling to the
bridge railings, it happened that, on certain evenings,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
when it rained, these fits of weakness that she had upon
the outer boulevard assumed the terrors of a nightmare.
When the light from the lanterns, trembling in misty
vapor, cast its varying, flickering reflection on the damp
ground; when the pavements, the sidewalks, the earth,
seemed to melt away and disappear under the rain, and
there was no appearance of solidity anywhere in the
aqueous darkness, the wretched creature, almost mad
with fatigue, would fancy that she could see a flood
rising in the gutter. A mirage of terror would show her
suddenly the water all about her, and creeping constantly
nearer to her. She would close her eyes, not
daring to move, fearing to feel her feet slip from under
her; she would begin to weep, and would weep on until
someone passed by and offered to escort her to the
<i>Hotel of the Little Blue Hand</i>.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span></p>




<hr />
<h2 class="chapter">LII</h2>


<p>She would then ascend the stairs; that was her last<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
place of refuge. She would fly from the rain and snow
and cold, from fear, despair, and fatigue. She would go
up and sit on the top step against Gautruche's closed
doors; she would draw her shawl and skirts closely
about her in order to leave room for those who went
and came up that long steep ladder, and would draw
back as far as possible into the corner in order that
her shame might fill but little space on the narrow
landing.</p>

<p>From the open doors the odor of unventilated closets,
of families heaped together in a single room, the exhalations
of unhealthy trades, the dense, greasy fumes of
cooking done in chafing-dishes on the floor, the stench
of rags and the faint damp smell of clothes drying in
the house, came forth and filled the hall. The broken-paned
window behind Germinie wafted to her nostrils
the fetid stench of a leaden pipe in which the whole
house emptied its refuse and its filth. Her stomach rose
in revolt every moment at a puff of infection; she was
obliged to take from her pocket a phial of melissa water<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
that she always carried, and swallow a mouthful of it to
avoid being ill.</p>

<p>But the staircase had its passers, too: honest workmen's
wives went up with a bushel of charcoal, or a pint
of wine for supper. Their feet would rub against her
as they passed, and as they went farther up, Germinie
would feel their scornful glances resting upon her and
falling upon her with more crushing force at every floor.
The children&mdash;little girls in <i>fanchons</i> who flitted up the
dark stairway and brightened it as if with flowers, little
girls in whom she saw, as she so often saw in dreams,
her own little one, living and grown to girlhood&mdash;she
saw them stop and look at her with wide open eyes that
seemed to recoil from her; then the little creatures would
turn and run breathlessly up-stairs, and, when they were
well out of reach, would lean over the rail until they
almost fell, and hurl impure jests at her, the insults of
the children of the common people. Insulting words,
poured out upon her by those rosebud mouths, wounded
Germinie more deeply than all else. She would half
rise for an instant; then, overwhelmed by shame,
resigning herself to her fate, she would fall back into
her corner, and, pulling her shawl over her head in
order to bury herself therein out of sight, she would sit
like a dead woman, crushed, inert, insensible, cowering
over her own shadow, like a bundle tossed on the
floor which everyone might tread upon&mdash;having no
control of her faculties, dead to everything except<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
the footsteps that she was listening for&mdash;and that did
not come.</p>

<p>At last, after long hours, hours that she could not
count, she would fancy that she heard a stumbling walk
in the street; then a vinous voice would mount the stairs,
stammering "<i>Canaille!</i> <i>canaille</i> of a saloon-keeper!&mdash;you
sold me the kind of wine that goes to my head!"</p>

<p>It was he.</p>

<p>And almost every day the same scene was enacted.</p>

<p>"Ah! there y'are, my Germinie," he would say as
his eyes fell upon her. "It's like this&mdash;I'll tell you all
about it. I'm a little bit under water." And, as he
put the key in the lock: "I'll tell you all about it. It
isn't my fault."</p>

<p>He would enter the room, kick aside a turtle-dove
with mangy wings that limped forward to greet him,
and close the door. "It wasn't me, d'ye see. It was
Paillon, you know Paillon? that little round fellow, fat
as a mad dog. Well, it was him, 'pon my honor. He
insisted on paying for a sixteen-sous bottle for me. He
offered to treat me, and I <i>proffered</i> him thanks. Thereupon
we naturally <i>consoled</i><a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> our coffee; when you're
consoled, you console! and as one thing led to another,
we fell upon each other! There was a very devil of a
carnage! The proof of it is that that gallows-bird of a
saloon-keeper threw us out-o'-doors like lobster shells!"</p>

<p>Germinie, during the explanation, would have lighted
the candle, stuck in a yellow copper candlestick. By<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
its flickering light the dirty paper on the walls could be
seen, covered with caricatures from <i>Charivari</i>, torn
from the paper and pasted on the wall.</p>

<p>"Well, you're a love!" Gautruche would exclaim,
as he saw her place a cold fowl and two bottles of wine
on the table. "For I must tell you all I've had in my
stomach to-day&mdash;a plate of wretched soup&mdash;that's all.
Ah! it must have taken a stout master-at-arms to put
that fellow's eyes out!"</p>

<p>And he would begin to eat. Germinie would sit with
her elbows on the table, watching him and drinking,
and her glance would grow dark.</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p>"Pshaw! all the négresses are dead,"<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Gautruche
would say at last, as he drained the bottles one by one.
"Put the children to bed!"</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p>Thereupon terrible, fierce, abhorrent outbursts of passion
would ensue between those two strange creatures,
savage ardor followed by savage satiety, frantic storms
of lust, caresses that were impregnated with the fierce
brutality of wine, kisses that seemed to seek the blood
beneath the skin, like the tongue of a wild beast, and at
the end, utter exhaustion that swallowed them up and
left their bodies like corpses.</p>

<p>Germinie plunged into these debauches with&mdash;what
shall I say?&mdash;delirium, madness, desperation, a sort of
supreme frenzy. Her ungovernable passions turned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
against themselves, and, going beyond their natural
appetites, forced themselves to suffer. Satiety exhausted
them without extinguishing them; and, overpassing the
widest limits of excess, they excited themselves to self-torture.
In the poor creature's paroxysms of excitement,
her brain, her nerves, the imagination of her
maddened body, no longer sought pleasure in pleasure,
but something sharper, keener, and more violent: pain
in pleasure. And the words "to die" constantly
escaped from her compressed lips, as if she were invoking
death in an undertone and seeking to embrace it in
the agonies of love.</p>

<p>Sometimes, in the night, she would suddenly sit up
on the edge of the bed, rest her bare feet on the cold
floor, and remain there, wild-eyed, listening to the
things that breathe in a sleeping-chamber. And little
by little the obscurity of the place and hour seemed to
envelop her. She seemed to herself to fall and writhe
helplessly in the blind unconsciousness of the night.
Her will became as naught. All sorts of black things,
that seemed to have wings and voices, beat against her
temples. The ghastly temptations that afford madness
a vague glimpse of crime caused a red light, the flash
of murder, to pass before her eyes, close at hand; and
hands placed against her back pushed her toward the
table where the knives lay. She would close her eyes
and move one foot; then fear would lay hold of her
and she would cling to the bedclothes; and at last she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
would turn around, fall back upon the bed, and go to
sleep beside the man she had been tempted to murder;
why? she had no idea; for nothing&mdash;for the sake of
killing!</p>

<p>And so, until daybreak, in that wretched furnished
lodging, the fierce struggle of those fatal passions would
continue, while the poor maimed, limping dove, the
infirm bird of Venus, nesting in one of Gautruche's old
shoes, would utter now and then, awakened by the noise,
a frightened coo.</p>

<h2 class="chapter">LIII</h2>


<p>In those days Gautruche became a little disgusted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span>
with drinking. He felt the first pangs of the disease of
the liver that had long been lurking in his heated, alcoholized
blood, under his brick-red cheek bones. The
horrible pains that gnawed at his side, and twisted the
cords of his stomach for a whole week, caused him to
reflect. There came to his mind, together with divers
resolutions inspired by prudence, certain almost sentimental
ideas of the future. He said to himself that he
must put a little more water into his life, if he wanted
to live to old age. While he lay writhing in bed and
tying himself into knots, with his knees up to his chin
to lessen the pain, he looked about at his den, the four
walls within which he passed his nights, to which he
brought his drunken body home in the evening, and
from which he fled into the daylight in the morning;
and he thought about making a real home for himself.
He dreamed of a room, where he could keep a wife, a
wife who would make him a good stew, look after him
if he were ill, straighten out his affairs, keep his linen in
order, prevent him from beginning a new score at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
wine-shop; a wife, in short, who would combine all the
useful qualities of a housekeeper, and who, in addition,
would not be a stupid fool, but would understand him
and laugh with him. Such a wife was all found: Germinie
was the very one. She probably had a little
hoard, a few sous laid by during the time she had been
in her old mistress's service; and with what he earned
they could "grub along" in comfort. He had no
doubt of her consent; he was sure beforehand that she
would accept his proposition. More than that, her
scruples, if she had any, would not hold out against the
prospect of marriage which he proposed to exhibit to
her at the end of their <i>liaison</i>.</p>

<p>One Monday she had come to his room as usual.</p>

<p>"Say, Germinie," he began, "what would you say
to this, eh? A good room&mdash;not like this box&mdash;a real
room, with a closet&mdash;at Montmartre, and two windows,
no less! Rue de l'Empereur&mdash;with a view an Englishman
would give five thousand francs to carry away with
him. Something first-class, bright, and cheerful, you
know, a place where you could stay all day without
hating yourself. Because, I tell you I'm beginning to
have enough of moving about here and there just to
change fleas. And that isn't all, either: I'm tired of
being cooped up in furnished lodgings, I'm tired of
being all alone. Friends don't make society. They
fall on you like flies in your glass when you're to pay,
and then, there you are! In the first place, I don't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
propose to drink any more, honor bright! no more for
me, you'll see! You understand I don't intend to use
myself up in this life, not if I know myself. Not by
any means! Attention! We mustn't let drink get the
better of us. It seemed to me those days as if I'd been
swallowing corkscrews. And I've no desire to knock at
the monument just yet. Well, to go from the thread to
the needle, this is what I thought: I'll make the proposition
to Germinie. I'll treat myself to a little furniture.
You've got what you have in your room. You
know I'm not much of a shirker, I haven't a lazy
bone in my body where work's concerned. And then
we might look to not always be working for others: we
might take a lodging-house for country thieves. If you
had a little something put aside, that would help. We
would join forces in genteel fashion, and have ourselves
straightened out some day before the mayor. That's
not such a bad scheme, is it, old girl, eh? And you'll
leave your old lady this time, won't you, for your dear
old Gautruche?"</p>

<p>Germinie, who had listened to him with her head thrust
forward and her chin resting on the palm of her hand,
threw herself back with a burst of strident laughter.</p>

<p>"Ha! ha! ha! You thought&mdash;and you have the
face to tell me so!&mdash;you thought I'd leave her! Mademoiselle?
Did you really think so? You're a fool,
you know! Why, you might have thousands and hundred
thousands, you might be stuffed with gold, do you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
hear? all stuffed with it. You're joking, aren't you?
Mademoiselle? Why, don't you know? haven't I ever
told you? I would like to see her die and these hands
not be there to close her eyes! I'd like to see it!
Come now, really, did you think so?"</p>

<p>"Damnation! I imagined, from the way you acted
with me, I thought you cared more for me than that&mdash;that
you loved me, in fact!" exclaimed the painter, disconcerted
by the terrible, stinging irony of Germinie's
words.</p>

<p>"Ah! you thought that, too&mdash;that I loved you!"
And, as if she were suddenly uprooting from the depths
of her heart the remorse and suffering of her passions,
she continued: "Well, yes! I do love you&mdash;I love you
as you love me! just as much! and that's all! I love
you as one loves something that is close at hand&mdash;that
one makes use of because it is there! I am used to you
as one gets used to an old dress and wears it again and
again. That's how I love you! How do you suppose
I should care for you? I'd like you to tell me what
difference it can make to me whether it's you or another?
For, after all, what have you been to me more than any
other man would be? In the first place, you took me.
Well? Is that enough to make me love you? What
have you done, then, to attach me to you, will you be
kind enough to tell me? Have you ever sacrificed a
glass of wine to me? Have you even so much as taken
pity on me when I was tramping about in the mud and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
snow at the risk of my life? Oh! yes! And what did
people say to me and spit out in my face so that my
blood boiled from one end of my body to the other!
You never troubled your head about all the insults I've
swallowed waiting for you! Look you! I've been
wanting to tell you all this for a long time&mdash;it's been
choking me. Tell me," she continued, with a ghastly
smile, "do you flatter yourself you've driven me wild
with your physical beauty, with your hair, which you've
lost, with that head of yours? Hardly! I took you&mdash;I'd
have taken anyone, it didn't matter who! It was
one of the times when I had to have someone! At
those times I don't know anything or see anything.
I'm not myself at all. I took you because it was a hot
day!"</p>

<p>She paused an instant.</p>

<p>"Go on," said Gautruche, "iron me on all the
seams. Don't mind me as long as your hand's in."</p>

<p>"So?" continued Germinie, "how enchanted you
imagined I was going to be to take up with you! You
said to yourself: 'The good-natured fool! she'll be
glad of the chance! And all I shall have to do will be
to promise to marry her. She'll throw up her place.
She'll leave her mistress in the lurch.' The idea!
Mademoiselle! Mademoiselle, who has no one but me!
Ah! you don't know anything about such things. You
wouldn't understand if I should tell you. Mademoiselle,
who is everything to me! Why, since my mother died,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
I've had nobody but her, never been treated kindly by
anybody but her! Who beside her ever said to me
when I was unhappy: 'Are you unhappy?' And, when
I was sick: 'Don't you feel well?' No one! There's
been no one but her to take care of me, to care what
became of me. God! and you talk of loving on
account of what there is between us! Ah! mademoiselle
has loved me! Yes, loved me! And I'm
dying of it, do you know? of having become such a
miserable creature as I am, a&mdash;&mdash;" She said the word.
"And of deceiving her, of stealing her affection, of
allowing her still to love me as her daughter! Ah! if
she should ever learn anything&mdash;but, no fear of that, it
won't be long. There's one woman who would make a
pretty leap out of a fifth-story window, as true as God is
my master! But fancy&mdash;you are not my heart, you are
not my life, you are only my pleasure. But I did have
a man. Ah! I don't know whether I loved him! but
you could have torn me to pieces for him without a
word from me. In short, he was the man that made me
what I am. Well, d'ye see, when my passion for him
was at its hottest, when I breathed only as he wished me
to, when I was mad over him and would have let him
walk on my stomach if he'd wanted to&mdash;even then, if
mademoiselle had been sick, if she had motioned to me
with her little finger, I'd have gone back to her. Yes, I
would have left him for her! I tell you I would have
left him!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span></p>

<p>"In that case&mdash;if that's the way things stand, my
dear&mdash;if you're so fond of your old lady as that, I have
only one piece of advice to give you: you'd better not
leave your good lady, d'ye see!"</p>

<p>"That's my dismissal, is it?" said Germinie, rising.</p>

<p>"Faith! it's very like it."</p>

<p>"Well! adieu. That suits me!"</p>

<p>She went straight to the door, and left the room
without a word.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span></p>




<hr />
<h2 class="chapter">LIV</h2>


<p>After this rupture Germinie fell where she was sure to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
fall, below shame, below nature itself. Lower and lower
the unhappy, passionate creature fell, until she wallowed
in the gutter. She took up the lovers whose passions
are exhausted in one night, those whom she passed or
met on the street, those whom chance throws in the
way of a wandering woman. She had no need to give
herself time for the growth of desire: her caprice was
fierce and sudden, kindled instantly. Pouncing greedily
upon the first comer, she hardly looked at him and
could not have recognized him. Beauty, youth, the
physical qualities of a lover, in which the passion of the
most degraded woman seeks to realize a base ideal, as it
were&mdash;none of those things tempted her now or touched
her. In all men her eyes saw nothing but man: the
individual mattered naught to her. The last indication
of decency and of human feeling in debauchery,&mdash;preference,
selection,&mdash;and even that which represents all
that prostitutes retain of conscience and personality,&mdash;disgust,
even disgust,&mdash;she had lost!</p>

<p>And she wandered about the streets at night, with the
furtive, stealthy gait of wild beasts prowling in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
shadow in quest of food. As if unsexed, she made the
advances, she solicited brutes, she took advantage of
drunkenness, and men yielded to her. She walked
along, peering on every side, approaching every shadowy
corner where impurity might lurk under cover of the
darkness and solitude, where hands were waiting to
swoop down upon a shawl. Belated pedestrians saw her
by the light of the street lanterns, an ill-omened, shuddering
phantom, gliding along, almost crawling, bent
double, slinking by in the shadow, with that appearance
of illness and insanity and of utter aberration which
sets the thoughtful man's heart and the physician's mind
at work on the brink of deep abysses of melancholy.</p>



<hr />
<h2 class="chapter">LV</h2>


<p>One evening when she was prowling about Rue du<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
Rocher, as she passed a wine-shop at the corner of Rue
de Labarde, she noticed the back of a man who was
drinking at the bar: it was Jupillon.</p>

<p>She stopped short, turned toward the street with her
back against the door of the wine-shop, and waited.
The light in the shop was behind her, her shoulders
against the bars, and there she stood motionless, her
skirt gathered up in one hand in front, and her other
hand falling listlessly at her side. She resembled a
statue of darkness seated on a milestone. In her attitude
there was an air of stern determination and the
necessary patience to wait there forever. The passers-by,
the carriages, the street&mdash;she saw them all indistinctly
and as if they were far away. The tow-horse, waiting
to assist in drawing the omnibuses up the hill,&mdash;a white
horse, he was,&mdash;stood in front of her, worn out and
motionless, sleeping on his feet, with his head and forefeet
in the bright light from the door: she did not see
him. There was a dense fog. It was one of those vile,
detestable Parisian nights when it seems as if the water
that falls had become mud before falling. The gutter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span>
rose and flowed about her feet. She remained thus half
an hour without moving, with her back to the light and
her face in the shadow, a threatening, desperate, forbidding
creature, like a statue of Fatality erected by
Darkness at a wine-shop door!</p>

<p>At last Jupillon came out. She stood before him
with folded arms.</p>

<p>"My money?" she said. Her face was that of a
woman who has ceased to possess a conscience, for
whom there is no God, no police, no assizes, no
scaffold&mdash;nothing!</p>

<p>Jupillon felt that his customary <i>blague</i> was arrested
in his throat.</p>

<p>"Your money?" he repeated; "your money ain't
lost. But I must have time. Just now, you see, work
ain't very plenty. That shop business of mine came to
grief a long while ago, you know. But in three months'
time, I promise. Are you pretty well?"</p>

<p>"<i>Canaille!</i> Ah! I've got you now! Ah! you'd
sneak away, would you? But it was you, my curse! it
was you who made me what I am, brigand! robber!
sneak! It was you."</p>

<p>Germinie hurled these words in his face, pushing
against him, forcing him back, pressing her body against
his. She seemed to be rubbing against the blows that
she invited and provoked, and as she leaned toward
him thus, she cried: "Come, strike me! What, then,
must I say to you to make you strike me?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span></p>

<p>She had ceased to think. She did not know what she
wanted; she simply felt that she needed to be struck.
There had come upon her an instinctive, irrational
desire to be maltreated, bruised, made to suffer in her
flesh, to experience a violent shock, a sharp pain that
would put a stop to what was going on in her brain.
She could think of nothing but blows to bring matters
to a crisis. After the blows, she saw, with the lucidity of
an hallucination, all sorts of things come to pass,&mdash;the
guard arriving, the gendarmes from the post, the commissioner!
the commissioner to whom she could tell
everything, her story, her misfortunes, how the man
before her had abused her and what he had cost her!
Her heart collapsed in anticipation at the thought of
emptying itself, with shrieks and tears, of everything
with which it was bursting.</p>

<p>"Come, strike me!" she repeated, still advancing
upon Jupillon, who tried to slink away, and, as he
retreated, tossed caressing words to her as you do to a
dog that does not recognize you and seems inclined to
bite. A crowd was beginning to collect about them.</p>

<p>"Come, old harridan, don't bother monsieur!" exclaimed
a police officer, grasping Germinie by the arm
and swinging her around roughly. Under that brutal
insult from the hand of the law, Germinie's knees
wavered: she thought she should faint. Then she was
afraid, and fled in the middle of the street.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span></p>




<hr />
<h2 class="chapter">LVI</h2>


<p>Passion is subject to the most insensate reactions,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
the most inexplicable revivals. The accursed love that
Germinie believed to have been killed by all the wounds
and blows Jupillon had inflicted upon it came to life
once more. She was dismayed to find it in her heart
when she returned home. The mere sight of the man,
his proximity for those few moments, the sound of his
voice, the act of breathing the air that he breathed,
were enough to turn her heart back to him and relegate
her to the past.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding all that had happened, she had never
been able to tear Jupillon's image altogether from her
heart: its roots were still imbedded there. He was her
first love. She belonged to him against her own will by
all the weaknesses of memory, by all the cowardice of
habit. Between them there were all the bonds of torture
that hold a woman fast forever,&mdash;sacrifice, suffering,
degradation. He owned her, body and soul, because he
had outraged her conscience, trampled upon her illusions,
made her life a martyrdom. She belonged to
him, belonged to him forever, as to the author of all her
sorrows.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span></p>

<p>And that shock, that scene which should have caused
her to think with horror of ever meeting him again,
rekindled in her the frenzied desire to meet him again.
Her passion seized her again in its full force. The
thought of Jupillon filled her mind so completely that it
purified her. She abruptly called a halt in the vagabondage
of her passions: she determined to belong thenceforth
to no one, as that was the only method by which
she could still belong to him.</p>

<p>She began to spy upon him, to make a study of his
usual hours for going out, the streets he passed through,
the places that he visited. She followed him to Batignolles,
to his new quarters, walked behind him, content
to put her foot where he had put his, to be guided by
his steps, to see him now and then, to notice a gesture
that he made, to snatch one of his glances. That was
all: she dared not speak to him; she kept at some distance
behind, like a lost dog, happy not to be driven
away with kicks.</p>

<p>For weeks and weeks she made herself thus the man's
shadow, a humble, timid shadow that shrank back and
moved away a few steps when it thought it was in danger
of being seen; then drew nearer again with faltering
steps, and, at an impatient movement from the man,
stopped once more, as if asking pardon.</p>

<p>Sometimes she waited at the door of a house which
he entered, caught him up again when he came out
and escorted him home, always at a distance, without<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
speaking to him, with the air of a beggar begging for
crumbs and thankful for what she was allowed to pick
up. Then she would listen at the shutters of the
ground-floor apartment in which he lived, to ascertain
if he was alone, if there was anybody there.</p>

<p>When he had a woman on his arm, although she
suffered keenly, she was the more persistent in following
him. She went where they went to the end. She
entered the public gardens and ballrooms behind them.
She walked within sound of their laughter and their
words, tore her heart to tatters looking at them and
listening to them, and stood at their backs with every
jealous instinct of her nature bleeding.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span></p>




<hr />
<h2 class="chapter">LVII</h2>


<p>It was November. For three or four days Germinie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span>
had not fallen in with Jupillon. She went to hover
about his lodgings, watching for him. When she reached
the street on which he lived, she saw a broad beam of
light struggling out through the closed shutters. She
approached and heard bursts of laughter, the clinking of
glasses, women's voices, then a song and one voice, that
of the woman whom she hated with all the hatred of her
heart, whom she would have liked to see lying dead
before her, and whose death she had so often sought to
discover in the coffee-grounds,&mdash;the cousin!</p>

<p>She glued her ear to the shutter, breathing in what
they said, absorbed in the torture of listening to them,
pasturing her famished heart upon suffering. It was a
cold, rainy winter's night. She did not feel the cold or
rain. All her senses were engaged in listening. The
voice she detested seemed at times to grow faint and
die away beneath kisses, and the notes it sang died in her
throat as if stifled by lips placed upon the song. The
hours passed. Germinie was still at her post. She did
not think of going away. She waited, with no knowledge
of what she was waiting for. It seemed to her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
that she must remain there always, until the end. The
rain fell faster. The water from a broken gutter overhead
beat down upon her shoulders. Great drops glided
down her neck. An icy shiver ran up and down her
back. The water dripped from her dress to the ground.
She did not notice it. She was conscious of no pain in
any of her limbs except the pain that flowed from her
heart.</p>

<p>Well on toward morning there was a movement in
the house, and footsteps approached the door. Germinie
ran and hid in a recess in the wall some steps away, and
from there saw a woman come out, escorted by a young
man. As she watched them walk away, she felt something
soft and warm on her hands that frightened her at
first; it was a dog licking her, a great dog that she had
held in her lap many an evening, when he was a puppy,
in the <i>crémière's</i> back shop.</p>

<p>"Come here, Molosse!" Jupillon shouted impatiently
twice or thrice in the darkness.</p>

<p>The dog barked, ran back, returned and gamboled
about her, and at last entered the house. The door
closed. The voices and singing lured Germinie back to
her former position against the shutter, and there she
remained, drenched by the rain, allowing herself to be
drenched, as she listened and listened, till morning, till
daybreak, till the hour when the masons on their way to
work, with their dinner loaf under their arms, began to
laugh at her as they passed.</p>



<hr />
<h2 class="chapter">LVIII</h2>


<p>Two or three days after that night in the rain, Germinie's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
features were distorted with pain, her skin was
like marble and her eyes blazing. She said nothing,
made no complaints, but went about her work as usual.</p>

<p>"Here! girl, look at me a moment," said mademoiselle,
and she led her abruptly to the window.
"What does all this mean? this look of a dead woman
risen from the grave? Come, tell me honestly, are you
sick? My God! how hot your hands are!"</p>

<p>She grasped her wrist, and in a moment threw it
down.</p>

<p>"What a silly slut! you're in a burning fever! And
you keep it to yourself!"</p>

<p>"Why no, mademoiselle," Germinie stammered. "I
think it's nothing but a bad cold. I went to sleep the
other evening with my kitchen window open."</p>

<p>"Oh! you're a good one!" retorted mademoiselle;
"you might be dying and you'd never as much as say:
'Ouf!' Wait."</p>

<p>She put on her spectacles, and hastily moving her
arm-chair to a small table by the fireplace, she wrote
a few lines in her bold hand.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span></p>

<p>"Here," said she, folding the note, "you will do
me the favor to give this to your friend Adèle and
have her send the concierge with it. And now to
bed you go!"</p>

<p>But Germinie refused to go to bed. It was not worth
while. She would not tire herself. She would sit down
all day. Besides, the worst of her sickness was over;
she was getting better already. And then it always
killed her to stay in bed.</p>

<p>The doctor, summoned by mademoiselle's note, came
in the evening. He examined Germinie, and ordered
the application of croton oil. The trouble in the chest
was of such a nature that he could say nothing about it
until he had observed the effect of his remedies.</p>

<p>He returned a few days later, sent Germinie to bed
and sounded her chest for a long while.</p>

<p>"It's a most extraordinary thing," he said to mademoiselle,
when he went downstairs; "she has had
pleurisy upon her and hasn't kept her bed for a
moment! Is she made of iron, in Heaven's name?
Oh! the energy of some women! How old is she?"</p>

<p>"Forty-one."</p>

<p>"Forty-one! Oh! it's not possible. Are you sure?
She looks fully fifty."</p>

<p>"Ah! as to that, she looks as old as you please.
What can you expect? Never in good health,&mdash;always
sick, disappointment, sorrow,&mdash;and a disposition that
can't help tormenting itself."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span></p>

<p>"Forty-one years old! it's amazing!" the physician
repeated.</p>

<p>After a moment's reflection, he continued:</p>

<p>"So far as you know, is there any hereditary lung
trouble in her family? Has she had any relatives who
have died young?"</p>

<p>"She lost a sister by pleurisy; but she was older.
She was forty-eight, I think."</p>

<p>The doctor had become very grave. "However, the
lung is getting freer," he said, in an encouraging tone.
"But it is absolutely necessary that she should have
rest. And send her to me once a week. Let her come
and see me. And let her take a pleasant day for it,&mdash;a
bright, sunny day."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span></p>




<hr />
<h2 class="chapter">LIX</h2>


<p>Mademoiselle talked and prayed and implored and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span>
scolded to no purpose: she could not induce Germinie
to lay aside her work for a few days. Germinie would
not even listen to the suggestion that she should have
an assistant to do the heavier work. She declared that
it was useless, impossible; that she could never endure
the thought of another woman approaching her, waiting
upon her, attending to her wants; that it would give
her a fever simply to think of such a thing as she lay in
bed; that she was not dead yet; and she begged that she
might be allowed to go on as usual, so long as she could
put one foot before the other. She said it in such an
affectionate tone, her eyes were so beseeching, her feeble
voice was so humble and so passionate in making the
request, that mademoiselle had not the courage to force
her to accept an assistant. She simply called her a
"blockhead," who believed, like all country-people,
that a few days in bed means death.</p>

<p>Keeping on her feet, with an apparent improvement
due to the physician's energetic treatment, Germinie
continued to make mademoiselle's bed, accepting her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
assistance to turn the mattresses. She also continued to
prepare her food, and that was an especially distasteful
task to her.</p>

<p>When she was preparing mademoiselle's breakfast
and dinner, she felt as if she should die in her kitchen,
one of the wretched little kitchens common in great
cities, which are the cause of so much pulmonary trouble
in women. The embers that she kindled, and from
which a thread of suffocating smoke slowly arose, began
to stir her stomach to revolt; soon the charcoal that
she bought from the charcoal dealer next door, strong
Paris charcoal, full of half-charred wood, enveloped her
in its stifling odor. The dirty, smoking funnel, the low
chimney-piece poured back into her lungs the corroding
heat of the waist-high oven. She suffocated, she felt
the fiery heat of all her blood surge upward to her
face and cause red blotches to appear on her forehead.
Her head whirled. In the half-asphyxiated condition
of laundresses who pass back and forth through
the vapor of their charcoal stoves, she would rush to
the window and draw a few breaths of the icy outside
air.</p>

<p>She had other motives for suffering on her feet, for
keeping constantly about her work despite her increasing
weakness, than the repugnance of country-people to
take to their beds, or her fierce, jealous determination
that no one but herself should attend to mademoiselle's
needs: she had a constant terror of denunciation, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
might accompany the installation of a new servant. It
was absolutely necessary that she should be there, to
keep watch on mademoiselle and prevent anyone from
coming near her. It was necessary, too, that she should
show herself, that the quarter should see her, and that
she should not appear to her creditors with the aspect
of a dead woman. She must make a pretence of being
strong, she must assume a cheerful, lively demeanor, she
must impart confidence to the whole street with the
doctor's studied words, with a hopeful air, and with
the promise not to die. She must appear at her best in
order to reassure her debtors and to prevent apprehensions
on the subject of money from ascending the stairs
and applying to mademoiselle.</p>

<p>She acted up to her part in this horrible, but necessary,
comedy. She was absolutely heroic in the way she
made her whole body lie,&mdash;in drawing up her enfeebled
form to its full height as she passed the shops, whose
proprietors' eyes were upon her; in quickening her
trailing footsteps; in rubbing her cheeks with a rough
towel before going out in order to bring back the color
of blood to them; in covering the pallor of her disease
and her death-mask with rouge.</p>

<p>Despite the terrible cough that racked her sleepless
nights, despite her stomach's loathing for food, she
passed the whole winter conquering and overcoming
her own weakness and struggling with the ups and
downs of her disease.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span></p>

<p>At every visit that he made, the doctor told mademoiselle
that he was unable to find that any of her maid's
vital organs were seriously diseased. The lungs were a
little ulcerated near the top; but people recovered from
that. "But her body seems worn out, thoroughly worn
out," he said again and again, in a sad tone, with an
almost embarrassed manner that impressed mademoiselle.
And he always had something to say, at the end
of his visit, about a change of air&mdash;about the country.</p>



<hr />
<h2 class="chapter">LX</h2>


<p>When August arrived, the doctor had nothing but that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
to advise or prescribe&mdash;the country. Notwithstanding
the repugnance of elderly people to move, to change
their abode and the habits and regular hours of their
life; despite her domestic nature and the sort of pang
that she felt at being torn from her hearthstone, mademoiselle
decided to take Germinie into the country.
She wrote to the <i>chick's</i> daughter, who lived, with a
brood of children, on a small estate in a village of
Brie, and who had been, for many years, begging her
to pay her a long visit. She requested her hospitality
for a month or six weeks for herself and her sick
maid.</p>

<p>They set out. Germinie was delighted. On their
arrival she felt decidedly better. For some days her
disease seemed to be diverted by the change. But the
weather that summer was very uncertain, with much
rain, sudden changes, and high winds. Germinie had
a chill, and mademoiselle soon heard again, overhead,
just above the room in which she slept, the frightful
cough that had been so painful and hard to bear at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
Paris. There were hurried paroxysms of coughing that
seemed almost to strangle her; spasms that would break
off for a moment, then begin again; and the pauses
caused the ear and the heart to experience a nervous,
anxious anticipation of what was certain to come next,
and always did come,&mdash;racking and tearing, dying
away again, but still vibrating in the ear, even when it
had ceased: never silent, never willing to have done.</p>

<p>And yet Germinie rose from those horrible nights with
an energy and activity that amazed mademoiselle and at
times reassured her. She was out of bed as early as anybody
in the house. One morning, at five o'clock, she
went with the man-servant in a <i>char-à-banc</i> to a mill-pond
three leagues away, for fish; at another time she
dragged herself to the saint's day ball, with the maids
from the house, and did not return until they did, at
daybreak. She worked all the time; assisted the servants.
She was always sitting on the edge of a chair,
in a corner of the kitchen, doing something with her
fingers. Mademoiselle was obliged to force her to go
out, to drive her into the garden to sit. Then Germinie
would sit on the green bench, with her umbrella over her
head, and the sun in her skirts and on her feet. Hardly
moving, she would forget herself utterly as she inhaled the
light and air and warmth, passionately and with a sort
of feverish joy. Her distended lips would part to admit
the fresh, clear air. Her eyes burned, but did not move;
and in the light shadow of the silk umbrella her gaunt,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
wasted, haggard face stared vacantly into space like an
amorous death's head.</p>

<p>Weary as she was at night, no persuasion could induce
her to retire before her mistress. She insisted upon
being at hand to undress her. Seated by her side, she
would rise from time to time to wait upon her as best
she could, assist her to take off a petticoat, then sit down
again, collect her strength for a moment, rise again, and
insist upon doing something for her. Mademoiselle had
to force her to sit down and order her to keep quiet.
And all the time that the evening toilet lasted she had
always upon her lips the same tiresome chatter about
the servants of the house.</p>

<p>"Why, mademoiselle, you haven't an idea of the eyes
they make at each other when they think no one sees
them&mdash;the cook and the man&mdash;I mean. They keep quiet
when I am by; but the other day I surprised them
in the bakery. They were kissing, fancy! Luckily
madame here don't suspect it."</p>

<p>"Ah! there you are again with your tale-bearing!
Why, good God!" mademoiselle would exclaim, "what
difference does it make to you whether they <i>coo</i> or don't
<i>coo</i>? They're kind to you, aren't they? That's all
that's necessary."</p>

<p>"Oh! very kind, mademoiselle; as far as that's concerned
I haven't a word to say. Marie got up in the
night last night to give me some water&mdash;and as for him,
when there's any dessert left, it's always for me. Oh!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[340]</a></span>
he's very polite to me&mdash;in fact, Marie don't like it very
well that he thinks so much about me. You understand,
mademoiselle&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Come, come! go to bed with all your nonsense!"
said her mistress sharply, sad, and annoyed as well, to
find such a keen interest in others' love-affairs in one
so ill.</p>



<hr />
<h2 class="chapter">LXI</h2>


<p>When they returned from the country, the doctor,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
after examining Germinie, said to Mademoiselle: "It
has been very rapid, very rapid. The left lung is entirely
gone. The right has begun to be affected at the
top, and I fear that there is more or less difficulty all
through it. She's a dead woman. She may live six
weeks, two months at most."</p>

<p>"Great Heaven!" said Mademoiselle de Varandeuil,
"everyone I have ever loved will go before me! Tell
me, must I wait until everybody has gone?"</p>

<p>"Have you thought of placing her in some institution?"
said the doctor, after a moment's silence.
"You can't keep her here. It's too great a burden,
too great a grief for you to have her with you," he
added, at a gesture from mademoiselle.</p>

<p>"No, monsieur, no, I haven't thought of it. Oh!
yes, I am likely to send her away. Why you must have
seen, monsieur: that girl isn't a maid, she isn't a servant
in my eyes; she's like the family I never had!
What would you have me say to her: 'Be off with you
now!' Ah! I never suffered so much before on account<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
of not being rich and having a wretched four-sou apartment
like this. I, mention such a thing to her! why,
it's impossible! And where could she go? To the
Maison Dubois? Oh! yes, to the Dubois! She went
there once to see the maid I had before, who died
there. You might as well kill her! The hospital,
then? No, not there; I don't choose to have her
die in that place!"</p>

<p>"Good God, mademoiselle, she'll be a hundred times
better off there than here. I would get her admitted
at Lariboisière, during the term of service of a doctor
who is a friend of mine. I would recommend her to
an intern, who is under great obligations to me. She
would have a very excellent Sister to nurse her in the
hall to which I would have her sent. If necessary, she
could have a private room. But I am sure she would
prefer to be in a common room. It's the essential
thing to do, you see, mademoiselle. She can't stay in
that chamber up there. You know what these horrible
servants' quarters are. Indeed, it's my opinion that
the health authorities ought to compel the landlords to
show common humanity in that direction; it's an outrage!
The cold weather is coming; there's no fireplace;
with the window and the roof it will be like an
ice-house. You see she still keeps about. She has a
marvelous stock of courage, prodigious nervous vitality.
But, in spite of everything, the bed will claim her in
a few days,&mdash;she won't get up again. Come, listen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
to reason, mademoiselle. Let me speak to her, will
you?"</p>

<p>"No, not yet. I must get used to the idea. And
then, when I see her around me I imagine she isn't
going to die so quickly as all that. There's time
enough. Later, we'll see about it,&mdash;yes, later."</p>

<p>"Excuse me, mademoiselle, if I venture to say to
you that you are quite capable of making yourself sick
nursing her."</p>

<p>"I? Oh! as for me!" And Mademoiselle de
Varandeuil made a gesture indicating that her life was
of no consequence.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span></p>




<hr />
<h2 class="chapter">LXII</h2>


<p>Amid Mademoiselle de Varandeuil's desperate anxiety<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
concerning her maid's health, she became conscious of
a strange feeling, a sort of fear in the presence of the
new, unfamiliar, mysterious creature that sickness had
made of Germinie. Mademoiselle had a sense of discomfort
beside that hollow, ghostly face, which was
almost unrecognizable in its implacable rigidity, and
which seemed to return to itself, to recover consciousness,
only furtively, by fits and starts, in the effort to
produce a pallid smile. The old woman had seen
many people die; her memories of many painful years
recalled the expressions of many dear, doomed faces, of
many faces that were sad and desolate and grief-stricken
in death; but no face of all those she remembered had
ever assumed, as the end drew near, that distressing
expression of a face retiring within itself and closing
the doors.</p>

<p>Enveloped in her suffering, Germinie maintained her
savage, rigid, self-contained, impenetrable demeanor.
She was as immovable as bronze. Mademoiselle, as
she looked at her, asked herself what it could be that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
she brooded over thus without moving; whether it was
her life rising in revolt, the dread of death, or a secret
remorse for something in her past. Nothing external
seemed to affect the sick woman. She was no longer
conscious of things about her. Her body became indifferent
to everything, did not ask to be relieved, seemed
not to desire to be cured. She complained of nothing,
found no pleasure or diversion in anything. Even her
longing for affection had left her. She no longer made
any motion to bestow or invite a caress, and every day
something human left her body, which seemed to be
turning to stone. Often she would bury herself in profound
silence that made one expect a heart-rending
shriek or word; but after glancing about the room,
she would say nothing and begin again to stare fixedly,
vacantly, at the same spot in space.</p>

<p>When mademoiselle returned from the friend's house
with whom she dined, she would find Germinie in the
dark, sunk in an easy-chair with her legs stretched out
upon a chair, her head hanging forward on her breast,
and so profoundly absorbed that sometimes she did not
hear the door open. As she walked forward into the
room it seemed to Mademoiselle de Varandeuil as if
she were breaking in upon a ghastly <i>tête-à-tête</i> between
Disease and the Shadow of Death, wherein Germinie
was already seeking, in the terror of the Invisible, the
blindness of the grave and the darkness of death.</p>



<hr />
<h2 class="chapter">LXIII</h2>


<p>Throughout the month of October, Germinie obstinately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
refused to take to her bed. Each day, however,
she was weaker and more helpless than the day before.
She was hardly able to ascend the flight of stairs that
led to her sixth floor, dragging herself along by the
railing. One day she fell on the stairs: the other
servants picked her up and carried her to her chamber.
But that did not stop her; the next day she went downstairs
again, with the fitful gleam of strength that invalids
commonly have in the morning. She prepared mademoiselle's
breakfast, made a pretence of working, and
kept moving about the apartment, clinging to the chairs
and dragging herself along. Mademoiselle took pity on
her; she forced her to lie down on her own bed. Germinie
lay there half an hour, an hour, wide awake, not
speaking, but with her eyes open, fixed, and staring
into vacancy like the eyes of a person in severe pain.</p>

<p>One morning she did not come down. Mademoiselle
climbed to the sixth floor, turned into a narrow corridor
in which the air was heavy with the odors from servants'
water-closets and at last reached Germinie's door,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
No. 21. Germinie apologized for having compelled
her to come up. It was impossible for her to put her
feet out of the bed. She had terrible pains in her
bowels and they were badly swollen. She begged mademoiselle
to sit down a moment and, to make room for
her, removed the candlestick that stood on the chair at
the head of her bed.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle sat down and remained a few moments,
looking about the wretched room,&mdash;one of those where
the doctor has to lay his hat on the bed, and where
there is barely room to die! It was a small attic room,
without a chimney, with a scuttle window in the sloping
roof, which admitted the heat of summer and the cold
of winter. Old trunks, clothes bags, a foot-bath, and
the little iron bedstead on which Germinie's niece had
slept, were heaped up in a corner under the sloping
roof. The bed, one chair, a little disabled washstand
with a broken pitcher, comprised the whole of the furniture.
Above the bed, in an imitation violet-wood
frame, hung a daguerreotype of a man.</p>

<p>The doctor came during the day. "Aha! peritonitis,"
he said, when mademoiselle described Germinie's
condition.</p>

<p>He went up to see the sick woman. "I am afraid,"
he said, when he came down, "that there's an abscess
in the intestine communicating with an abscess in the
bladder. It's a serious case, very serious. You must
tell her not to move about much in her bed, to turn over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
with great care. She might die suddenly in horrible
agony. I suggested to her to go to Lariboisière,&mdash;she
agreed at once. She seemed to have no repugnance at
all. But I don't know how she will bear the journey.
However, she has such an unlimited stock of energy; I
have never seen anything like it. To-morrow morning
you shall have the order of admission."</p>

<p>When mademoiselle went up to Germinie's room
again, she found her smiling in her bed, gay as a lark
at the idea of going away.</p>

<p>"It's a matter of six weeks at most, mademoiselle,"
said she.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[350]</a></span></p>





<hr />
<h2 class="chapter">LXIV</h2>


<p>At two o'clock the next day the doctor brought the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
order for her admission to Lariboisière. The invalid
was ready to start. Mademoiselle suggested that they
should send to the hospital for a litter. "Oh! no,"
said Germinie, hastily, "I should think I was dead."
She was thinking of her debts; she must show herself
to her creditors on the street, alive, and on her feet to
the last!</p>

<p>She got out of bed. Mademoiselle de Varandeuil
assisted her to put on her petticoat and her dress. As
soon as she left her bed, all signs of life disappeared
from her face, the flush from her complexion: it seemed
as if earth suddenly took the place of blood under her
skin. She went down the steep servants' stairway,
clinging to the baluster, and reached her mistress's
apartments. She sat down in an arm-chair near the
window in the dining-room. She insisted upon putting
on her stockings without assistance, and as she pulled
them on with her poor trembling hands, the fingers
striking against one another, she afforded a glimpse of
her legs, which were so thin as to make one shudder.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
The housekeeper, meanwhile, was putting together in
a bundle a little linen, a glass, a cup, and a pewter
plate, which she wished to carry with her. When that
was done, Germinie looked about her for a moment;
she cast one last glance around the room, a glance
that seemed to long to take everything away with her.
Then, as her eyes rested on the door through which
the housekeeper had just gone out, she said to mademoiselle:
"At all events I leave a good woman with
you."</p>

<p>She rose. The door closed noisily behind her, as if
to say adieu, and, supported by Mademoiselle de Varandeuil,
who almost carried her, she went down the five
flights of the main stairway. At every landing she
paused to take breath. In the vestibule she found the
concierge, who had brought her a chair. She fell into
it. The vulgar fellow laughingly promised her that
she would be well in six weeks. She moved her head
slightly as she said <i>yes</i>, a muffled <i>yes</i>.</p>

<p>She was in the cab, beside her mistress. It was an
uncomfortable cab and jolted over the pavements. She
sat forward on the seat to avoid the concussion of the
jolting, and clung to the door with her hand. She
watched the houses pass, but did not speak. When they
reached the hospital gate, she refused to be carried.
"Can you walk as far as that?" said the concierge,
pointing to the reception-room some sixty feet distant.
She made an affirmative sign and walked: it was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
dead woman walking, because she was determined to
walk!</p>

<p>At last she reached the great hall, cold and stiff and
clean and bare and horrible, with a circle of wooden
benches around the waiting litter. Mademoiselle de
Varandeuil led her to a straw chair near a glazed door.
A clerk opened the door, asked Mademoiselle de Varandeuil
Germinie's name and age, and wrote for a quarter
of an hour, covering ten or more sheets of paper with a
religious emblem at the top. That done, Mademoiselle
de Varandeuil kissed her and turned to go; she saw an
attendant take her under the arms, then she saw no
more, but turned and fled, and, throwing herself upon
the cushions of the cab, she burst into sobs and gave
vent to all the tears with which her heart had been
suffocated for an hour past. The driver on his box was
amazed to hear such violent weeping.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span></p>




<hr />
<h2 class="chapter">LXV</h2>


<p>On the visiting day, Thursday, mademoiselle started<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
at half-past twelve to go and see Germinie. It was her
purpose to be at her bedside at the moment the doors
were thrown open, at one o'clock precisely. As she
rode through the streets she had passed through four
days before, she remembered the ghastly ride of Monday.
It seemed to her as if she were incommoding a
sick person in the cab, of which she was the only occupant,
and she sat close in the corner in order to make
room for the memory of Germinie. In what condition
should she find her? Should she find her at all?
Suppose her bed should be empty?</p>

<p>The cab passed through a narrow street filled with
orange carts, and with women sitting on the sidewalk
offering biscuit for sale in baskets. There was something
unspeakably wretched and dismal in this open-air
display of fruit and cakes,&mdash;the delicacies of the
dying, the <i>viaticum</i> of invalids, craved by feverish
mouths, longed for by the death-agony,&mdash;which workingmen's
hands, black with toil, purchase as they pass,
to carry to the hospital and offer death a tempting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
morsel. Children carried them with sober faces, almost
reverentially, and without touching them, as if they
understood.</p>

<p>The cab stopped before the gate of the courtyard.
It was five minutes to one. There was a long line of
women crowding about the gate, women with their
working clothes on, sorrowful, depressed and silent.
Mademoiselle de Varandeuil took her place in the line,
went forward with the others and was admitted: they
searched her. She inquired for Salle Sainte-Joséphine,
and was directed to the second wing on the second
floor. She found the hall and the bed, No. 14, which
was, as she had been told, one of the last at the right.
Indeed, she was guided thither, as it were, from the
farther end of the hall, by Germinie's smile&mdash;the
smile of a sick person in a hospital at an unexpected
visit, which says, so gently, as soon as you enter the
room: "Here I am."</p>

<p>She leaned over the bed. Germinie tried to push her
away with a gesture of humility and the shamefacedness
of a servant.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle de Varandeuil kissed her.</p>

<p>"Ah!" said Germinie, "the time dragged terribly
yesterday. I imagined it was Thursday and I longed so
for you."</p>

<p>"My poor girl! How are you?"</p>

<p>"Oh! I'm getting on finely now&mdash;the swelling in
my bowels has all gone. I have only three weeks to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
stay here, mademoiselle, you'll see. They talk about a
month or six weeks, but I know better. And I'm very
comfortable here, I don't mind it at all. I sleep all
night now. My! but I was thirsty, when you brought
me here Monday! They wouldn't give me wine and
water."</p>

One and all, after a moment&#39;s conversation, leaned
over Germinie to kiss her, and with every kiss Mademoiselle
de Varandeuil could hear an indistinct murmur

<p>"What have you there to drink?"</p>

<p>"Oh! what I had at home&mdash;lime-water. Would you
mind pouring me out some, mademoiselle? their pewter
things are so heavy!"</p>

<p>She raised herself with one arm by the aid of the
little stick that hung over the middle of the bed, and
putting out the other thin, trembling arm, left bare
by the sleeve falling back from it, she took the glass
mademoiselle held out to her, and drank.</p>

<p>"There," said she when she had done, and she
placed both her arms outside the bed, on the coverlid.</p>

<p>"What a pity that I have to put you out in this way,
my poor demoiselle!" she continued. "Things must
be in a horribly dirty state at home!"</p>

<p>"Don't worry about that."</p>

<p>There was a moment's silence. A faint smile came
to Germinie's lips. "I am sailing under false colors,"
she said, lowering her voice; "I have confessed so as
to get well."</p>

<p>Then she moved her head on the pillow in order to
bring her mouth nearer to Mademoiselle de Varandeuil's
ear:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span></p>

<p>"There are tales to tell here. I have a funny neighbor
yonder." She indicated with a glance and a movement
of her shoulder the patient to whom her back was
turned. "There's a man who comes here to see her.
He talked to her an hour yesterday. I heard them say
they'd had a child. She has left her husband. He was
like a madman, the man was, when he was talking to
her."</p>

<p>As she spoke, Germinie's face lighted up as if she
were still full of the scene of the day before, still stirred
up and feverish with jealousy, so near death as she was,
because she had heard love spoken of beside her!</p>

<p>Suddenly her expression changed. A woman came
toward her bed. She seemed embarrassed when she
saw Mademoiselle de Varandeuil. After a few moments,
she kissed Germinie, and hurriedly withdrew as another
woman came up. The new-comer did the same, kissed
Germinie and at once took her leave. After the women
a man came; then another woman. One and all, after
a moment's conversation, leaned over Germinie to kiss
her, and with every kiss Mademoiselle de Varandeuil
could hear an indistinct murmur as of words exchanged;
a whispered question from those who kissed,
a hasty reply from her who was kissed.</p>

<p>"Well!" she said to Germinie, "I hope you are
well taken care of!"</p>

<p>"Oh! yes," Germinie answered in a peculiar tone,
"they take excellent care of me!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span></p>

<p>She had lost the animation that she displayed at the
beginning of the visit. The little blood that had
mounted to her cheeks remained there in one spot
only. Her face seemed closed; it was cold and deaf,
like a wall. Her drawn-in lips were sealed, as it were.
Her features were concealed beneath the veil of infinite
dumb agony. There was nothing caressing or eloquent
in her staring eyes, absorbed as they were and filled with
one fixed thought. You would have said that all exterior
signs of her ideas were drawn within her by an
irresistible power of concentration, by a last supreme
effort of her will, and that her whole being was clinging
in desperation to a sorrow that drew everything
to itself.</p>

<p>The visitors she had just received were the grocer,
the fish-woman, the butter woman and the laundress&mdash;all
her debts, incarnate! The kisses were the kisses of
her creditors, who came to keep on the scent of their
claims and to extort money from her death-agony!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span></p>




<hr />
<h2 class="chapter">LXVI</h2>


<p>Mademoiselle had just risen on Saturday morning.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_361" id="Page_361">[361]</a></span>
She was making a little package of four jars of Bar preserves,
which she intended to carry to Germinie the
next day, when she heard low voices, a colloquy between
the housekeeper and the concierge in the reception
room. Almost immediately the door opened and
the concierge came in.</p>

<p>"Sad news, mademoiselle," he said.</p>

<p>And he handed her a letter he had in his hand; it
bore the stamp of the Lariboisière hospital: Germinie
was dead; she died at seven o'clock that morning.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle took the letter; she saw only the letters
that said: "Dead! dead!" And they repeated the
word: "Dead! dead!" to no purpose, for she could
not believe it. As is always the case with a person of
whose death one learns abruptly, Germinie appeared to
her instinct with life, and her body, which was no
more, seemed to stand before her with the awe-inspiring
presence of a ghost. Dead! She should never see her
more! So there was no longer a Germinie on earth!
Dead! She was dead! And the person she should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a></span>
hear henceforth moving about in the kitchen would not
be she; somebody else would open the door for her,
somebody else would potter about her room in the
morning! "Germinie!" she cried at last, in the tone
with which she was accustomed to call her; then, collecting
her thoughts: "Machine! creature! What's
your name?" she cried, savagely, to the bewildered
housekeeper. "My dress&mdash;I must go there."</p>

<p>She was so taken by surprise by this sudden fatal termination
of the disease, that she could not accustom her
mind to the thought. She could hardly realize that
sudden, secret, vague death, of which her only knowledge
was derived from a scrap of paper. Was Germinie
really dead? Mademoiselle asked herself the
question with the doubt of persons who have lost a dear
one far away, and, not having seen her die, do not
admit that she is dead. Was she not still alive the last
time she saw her? How could it have happened? How
could she so suddenly have become a thing good for
nothing except to be put under ground? Mademoiselle
dared not think about it, and yet she kept on thinking.
The mystery of the death-agony, of which she knew
nothing, attracted and terrified her. The anxious interest
of her affection turned to her maid's last hours, and
she tried gropingly to take away the veil and repel the
feeling of horror. Then she was seized with an irresistible
longing to know everything, to witness, with the
help of what might be told her, what she had not seen.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
She felt that she must know if Germinie had spoken before
she died,&mdash;if she had expressed any desire, spoken
of any last wishes, uttered one of those sentences which
are the final outcry of life.</p>

<p>When she reached Lariboisière, she passed the concierge,&mdash;a
stout man reeking with life as one reeks with
wine,&mdash;passed through the corridors where pallid convalescents
were gliding hither and thither, and rang at a
door, veiled with white curtains, at the extreme end of
the hospital. The door was opened: she found herself
in a parlor, lighted by two windows, where a plaster cast
of the Virgin stood upon an altar, between two views of
Vesuvius, which seemed to shiver against the bare wall.
Behind her, through an open door, came the voices of
Sisters and little girls chattering together, a clamor of
youthful voices and fresh laughter, the natural gayety of
a cheery room where the sun frolics with children at play.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle asked to speak with the <i>mother</i> of Salle
Sainte-Joséphine. A short, half-deformed Sister, with a
kind, homely face, a face alight with the grace of God,
came in answer to her request. Germinie had died in
her arms. "She hardly suffered at all," the Sister told
mademoiselle; "she was sure that she was better; she
felt relieved; she was full of hope. About seven this
morning, just as her bed was being made, she suddenly
began vomiting blood, and passed away without knowing
that she was dying." The Sister added that she
had said nothing, asked for nothing, expressed no wish.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span></p>

<p>Mademoiselle rose, delivered from the horrible thoughts
she had had. Germinie had been spared all the tortures
of the death-agony that she had dreamed of. Mademoiselle
was grateful for that death by the hand of God
which gathers in the soul at a single stroke.</p>

<p>As she was going away an attendant came to her
and said: "Will you be kind enough to identify the
body?"</p>

<p><i>The body!</i> The words gave mademoiselle a terrible
shock. Without awaiting her reply, the attendant led
the way to a high yellow door, over which was written:
<i>Amphitheatre</i>. He knocked; a man in shirt sleeves,
with a pipe in his mouth, opened the door and bade
them wait a moment.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle waited. Her thoughts terrified her.
Her imagination was on the other side of that awful
door. She tried to anticipate what she was about to
see. And her mind was so filled with confused images,
with fanciful alarms, that she shuddered at the thought
of entering the room, of recognizing that disfigured
face among a number of others, if, indeed, she could
recognize it! And yet she could not tear herself
away; she said to herself that she should never see
her again!</p>

<p>The man with the pipe opened the door: mademoiselle
saw nothing but a coffin, the lid of which extended
only to the neck, leaving Germinie's face uncovered,
with the eyes open, and the hair erect upon her head.</p>



<hr />
<h2 class="chapter">LXVII</h2>


<p>Prostrated by the excitement and by this last spectacle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
Mademoiselle de Varandeuil took to her bed on
returning home, after she had given the concierge the
money for the purchase of a burial lot, and for the
burial. And when she was in bed the things she had
seen arose before her. The horrible dead body was
still beside her, the ghastly face framed by the coffin.
That never-to-be-forgotten face was engraved upon her
mind; beneath her closed eyelids she saw it and was
afraid of it. Germinie was there, with the distorted
features of one who has been murdered, with sunken
orbits and eyes that seemed to have withdrawn into
their holes! She was there with her mouth still distorted
by the vomiting that accompanied her last
breath! She was there with her hair, her terrible hair,
brushed back and standing erect upon her head!</p>

<p>Her hair!&mdash;that haunted mademoiselle more persistently
than all the rest. The old maid thought, involuntarily,
of things that had come to her ears when
she was a child, of superstitions of the common people
stored away in the background of her memory; she asked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
herself if she had not been told that dead people whose
hair is like that carry a crime with them to the grave.
And at times it was such hair as that that she saw upon
that head, the hair of crime, standing on end with terror
and stiffened with horror before the justice of Heaven,
like the hair of the condemned man before the scaffold
in La Grève!</p>

<p>On Sunday mademoiselle was too ill to leave her bed.
On Monday she tried to rise and dress, in order to
attend the funeral; but she was attacked with faintness,
and was obliged to return to her bed.</p>



<hr />
<h2 class="chapter">LXVIII</h2>


<p>"Well! is it all over?" said mademoiselle from her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
bed, as the concierge entered her room about eleven
o'clock, on his return from the cemetery, with the
black coat and the sanctimonious manner suited to the
occasion.</p>

<p>"<i>Mon Dieu</i>, yes, mademoiselle. Thank God! the
poor girl is out of pain."</p>

<p>"Stay! I have no head to-day. Put the receipts and
the rest of the money on my table. We will settle our
accounts some other day."</p>

<p>The concierge stood before her without moving or
evincing any purpose to go, shifting from one hand to
the other a blue velvet cap made from the dress of one
of his daughters. After a moment's reflection, he
decided to speak.</p>

<p>"This burying is an expensive business, mademoiselle.
In the first place, there's&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Who asked you to give the figures?" Mademoiselle
de Varandeuil interrupted, with the haughty air
of superb charity.</p>

<p>The concierge continued: "And as I was saying, a
lot in the cemetery, which you told me to get, ain't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
given away. It's no use for you to have a kind heart,
mademoiselle, you ain't any too rich,&mdash;everyone knows
that,&mdash;and I says to myself: 'Mademoiselle's going to
have no small amount to pay out, and I know mademoiselle,
she'll pay.' So it'll do no harm to economize
on that, eh? It'll be just so much saved. The other'll
be just as safe under ground. And then, what will give
her the most pleasure up yonder? Why, to know that
she isn't making things hard for anybody, the excellent
girl."</p>

<p>"Pay? What?" said mademoiselle, out of patience
with the concierge's circumlocution.</p>

<p>"Oh! that's of no account," he replied; "she was
very fond of you, all the same. And then, when she
was very sick, it wasn't the time. Oh! <i>Mon Dieu</i>, you
needn't put yourself out&mdash;there's no hurry about it&mdash;it's
money she owed a long while. See, this is it."</p>

<p>He took a stamped paper from the inside pocket of
his coat.</p>

<p>"I didn't want her to make a note,&mdash;she insisted."</p>

<p>Mademoiselle de Varandeuil seized the stamped paper
and saw at the foot:</p>

<p style="margin-top: 2em;"><i>"I acknowledge the receipt of the above amount.</i></p>

<div class="sc" style="margin-left: 10em; margin-bottom: 2em;">Germinie Lacerteux."</div>

<p>It was a promise to pay three hundred francs in
monthly installments, which were to be endorsed on the
back.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span></p>

<p>"There's nothing there, you see," said the concierge,
turning the paper over.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle de Varandeuil took off her spectacles.
"I will pay," she said.</p>

<p>The concierge bowed. She glanced at him; he did
not move.</p>

<p>"That is all, I hope?" she said, sharply.</p>

<p>The concierge had his eyes fixed on a leaf in the
carpet. "That's all&mdash;unless&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Mademoiselle de Varandeuil had the same feeling of
terror as at the moment she passed through the door on
whose other side she was to see her maid's dead body.</p>

<p>"But how does she owe all this?" she cried. "I
paid her good wages, I almost clothed her. Where
did her money go, eh?"</p>

<p>"Ah! there you are, mademoiselle. I should rather
not have told you,&mdash;but as well to-day as to-morrow.
And then, too, it's better that you should be warned;
when you know beforehand you can arrange matters.
There's an account with the poultry woman. The
poor girl owed a little everywhere; she didn't keep
things in very good shape these last few years. The
laundress left her book the last time she came. It
amounts to quite a little,&mdash;I don't know just how much.
It seems there's a note at the grocer's&mdash;an old note&mdash;it
goes back years. He'll bring you his book."</p>

<p>"How much at the grocer's?"</p>

<p>"Something like two hundred and fifty."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span></p>

<p>All these disclosures, falling upon Mademoiselle de
Varandeuil, one after another, extorted exclamations of
stupefied surprise from her. Resting her elbow on her
pillow, she said nothing as the veil was torn away, bit
by bit, from this life, as its shameful features were
brought to light one by one.</p>

<p>"Yes, about two hundred and fifty. There's a good
deal of wine, he tells me."</p>

<p>"I have always had wine in the cellar."</p>

<p>"The <i>crémière</i>," continued the concierge, without
heeding her remark, "that's no great matter,&mdash;some
seventy-five francs. It's for absinthe and brandy."</p>

<p>"She drank!" cried Mademoiselle de Varandeuil,
everything made clear to her by those words.</p>

<p>The concierge did not seem to hear.</p>

<p>"You see, mademoiselle, knowing the Jupillons was
the death of her,&mdash;the young man especially. It wasn't
for herself that she did what she did. And the disappointment,
you see. She took to drink. She hoped to
marry him, I ought to say. She fitted up a room for
him. When they get to buying furniture the money
goes fast. She ruined herself,&mdash;think of it! It was
no use for me to tell her not to throw herself away by
drinking as she did. You don't suppose I was going to
tell you, when she came in at six o'clock in the morning!
It was the same with her child. Oh!" the concierge
added, in reply to mademoiselle's gesture, "it
was a lucky thing the little one died. Never mind, you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
can say she led a gay life&mdash;and a hard one. That's
why I say the common ditch. If I was you&mdash;she's
cost you enough, mademoiselle, all the time she's
been living on you. And you can leave her where
she is&mdash;with everybody else."</p>

<p>"Ah! that's how it is! that's what she was! She
stole for men! she ran in debt! Ah! she did well
to die, the hussy! And I must pay! A child!&mdash;think
of that: the slut! Yes, indeed, she can rot where she
will! You have done well, Monsieur Henri. Steal!
She stole from me! In the ditch, parbleu! that's quite
good enough for her! To think that I let her keep all
my keys&mdash;I never kept any account. My God! That's
what comes of confidence. Well! here we are&mdash;I'll
pay&mdash;not on her account, but on my own. And I gave
her my best pair of sheets to be buried in! Ah! if
I'd known I'd have given you the kitchen dish-clout,
<i>mademoiselle how I am duped</i>!"</p>

<p>And mademoiselle continued in this strain for some
moments until the words choked one another in her
throat and strangled her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span></p>




<hr />
<h2 class="chapter">LXIX</h2>


<p>As a result of this scene, Mademoiselle de Varandeuil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span>

kept her bed a week, ill and raging, filled with indignation
that shook her whole body, overflowed through her
mouth, and tore from her now and again some coarse
insult which she would hurl with a shriek of rage at
her maid's vile memory. Night and day she was possessed
by the same fever of malediction, and even in
her dreams her attenuated limbs were convulsed with
wrath.</p>

<p>Was it possible! Germinie! her Germinie! She
could think of nothing else. Debts!&mdash;a child!&mdash;all
sorts of shame! The degraded creature! She abhorred
her, she detested her. If she had lived she would have
denounced her to the police. She would have liked to
believe in hell so that she might be consigned to the
torments that await the dead. Her maid was such a
creature as that! A girl who had been in her service
twenty years! whom she had loaded down with benefits!
Drunkenness! she had sunk so low as that!
The horror that succeeds a bad dream came to mademoiselle,
and all the waves of loathing that flowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
from her heart said: "Out upon the dead woman
whose life the grave vomited forth and whose filth it
cast out!"</p>

<p>How she had deceived her! How the wretch had
pretended to love her! And to make her appear more
ungrateful and more despicable Mademoiselle de Varandeuil
recalled her manifestations of affection, her attentions,
her jealousies, which seemed a part of her adoration.
She saw her bending over her when she was ill.
She thought of her caresses. It was all a lie! Her devotion
was a lie! The delight with which she kissed her,
the love upon her lips, were lies! Mademoiselle told
herself over and over again, she persuaded herself that
it was so; and yet, little by little, from these reminiscences,
from these evocations of the past whose bitterness
she sought to make more bitter, from the far-off
sweetness of days gone by, there arose within her a first
sensation of pity.</p>

<p>She drove away the thoughts that tended to allay her
wrath; but reflection brought them back. Thereupon
there came to her mind some things to which she had
paid no heed during Germinie's lifetime, trifles of
which the grave makes us take thought and upon
which death sheds light. She had a vague remembrance
of certain strange performances on the part of
her maid, of feverish effusions and frantic embraces, of
her throwing herself on her knees as if she were about
to make a confession, of movements of the lips as if a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
secret were trembling on their verge. She saw, with
the eyes we have for those who are no more, Germinie's
wistful glances, her gestures and attitudes, the despairing
expression of her face. And now she realized that there
were deep wounds beneath, heart-rending pain, the torment
of her anguish and her repentance, the tears of
blood of her remorse, all sorts of suffering forced out
of sight throughout her life, and in her whole being a
Passion of shame that dared not ask forgiveness except
with silence!</p>

<p>Then she would scold herself for the thought and call
herself an old fool. Her instinct of rigid uprightness,
the stern conscience and harsh judgment of a stainless
life, the things which cause a virtuous woman to
condemn a harlot and should have caused a saint like
Mademoiselle de Varandeuil to be without pity for her
servant&mdash;everything within her rebelled against a pardon.
The voice of justice, stifling her kindness of heart,
cried: "Never! never!" And she would expel Germinie's
infamous phantom with a pitiless gesture.</p>

<p>There were times, indeed, when, in order to make
her condemnation and execration of her memory more
irrevocable, she would heap charges upon her and slander
her. She would add to the dead woman's horrible
list of sins. She would reproach Germinie for more
than was justly chargeable to her. She would attribute
crimes to her dark thoughts, murderous desires to her
impatient dreams. She would strive to think, she would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
force herself to think, that she had desired her mistress's
death and had been awaiting it.</p>

<p>But at that very moment, amid the blackest of her
thoughts and suppositions, a vision arose and stood in
a bright light before her. A figure approached, that
seemed to come to meet her glance, a figure against
which she could not defend herself, and which passed
through the hands with which she sought to force it
back. Mademoiselle de Varandeuil saw her dead maid
once more. She saw once more the face of which she
had caught a glimpse in the amphitheatre, the crucified
face, the tortured face to which the blood and agony of
a heart had mounted together. She saw it once more
with the faculty which the second sight of memory separates
from its surroundings. And that face, as it became
clearer to her, caused her less terror. It appeared to
her, divesting itself, as it were, of its fear-inspiring, horrifying
qualities. Suffering alone remained, but it was
the suffering of expiation, almost of prayer, the suffering
of a dead face that would like to weep. And as its expression
grew ever milder, mademoiselle came at last to
see in it a glance of supplication, of supplication that,
at last, compelled her pity. Insensibly there glided into
her reflections indulgent thoughts, suggestions of apology
that surprised herself. She asked herself if the poor girl
was as guilty as others, if she had deliberately chosen the
path of evil, if life, circumstances, the misfortune of her
body and her destiny, had not made her the creature she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
had been, a creature of love and sorrow. Suddenly she
stopped: she was on the point of forgiving her!</p>

<p>One morning she leaped out of bed.</p>

<p>"Here! you&mdash;you other!" she cried to her housekeeper,
"the devil take your name! I can't remember
it. Give me my clothes, quick! I have to go out."</p>

<p>"The idea, mademoiselle&mdash;just look at the roofs,
they're all white."</p>

<p>"Well, it snows, that's all."</p>

<p>Ten minutes later, Mademoiselle de Varandeuil said
to the driver of the cab she had sent for:</p>

<p>"Montmartre Cemetery!"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span></p>




<hr />
<h2 class="chapter">LXX</h2>


<p>In the distance an enclosure wall extended, perfectly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_379" id="Page_379">[379]</a></span>
straight, as far as the eye could see. The thread of
snow that marked the outline of its coping gave it a
dirty, rusty color. In a corner at the left three leafless
trees reared their bare black branches against the sky.
They rustled sadly, with the sound of pieces of dead
wood stirred by the south wind. Above these trees,
behind the wall and close against it, arose the two arms
from which hung one of the last oil-lamps in Paris. A
few snow-covered roofs were scattered here and there;
beyond, the hill of Montmartre rose sharply, its white
shroud broken by oases of brown earth and sandy
patches. Low gray walls followed the slope, surmounted
by gaunt, stunted trees whose branches had a bluish tint
in the mist, as far as two black windmills. The sky was
of a leaden hue, with occasional cold, bluish streaks as
if ink had been applied with a brush! over Montmartre
there was a light streak, of a yellow color, like the Seine
water after heavy rains. Above that wintry beam the
wings of an invisible windmill turned and turned,&mdash;slow-moving
wings, unvarying in their movement, which
seemed to be turning for eternity.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_380" id="Page_380">[380]</a></span></p>

<p>In front of the wall, against which was planted a
thicket of dead cypresses, turned red by the frost, was a
vast tract of land upon which were two rows of crowded,
jostling overturned crosses, like two great funeral processions.
The crosses touched and pushed one another
and trod on one another's heels. They bent and fell
and collapsed in the ranks. In the middle there was a
sort of congestion which had caused them to bulge out
on both sides; you could see them lying&mdash;covered by
the snow and raising it into mounds with the thick wood
of which they were made&mdash;upon the paths, somewhat
trampled in the centre, that skirted the two long
files. The broken ranks undulated with the fluctuation
of a multitude, the disorder and wavering course
of a long march. The black crosses with their arms
outstretched assumed the appearance of ghosts and
persons in distress. The two disorderly columns
made one think of a human panic, a desperate, frightened
army. It was as if one were looking on at a
terrible rout.</p>

<p>All the crosses were laden with wreaths, wreaths of
immortelles, wreaths of white paper with silver thread,
black wreaths with gold thread; but you could see them
beneath the snow, worn out, withered, ghastly things,
souvenirs, as it were, which the other dead would not
accept and which had been picked up in order to make
a little toilet for the crosses with gleanings from the
graves.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_381" id="Page_381">[381]</a></span></p>

<p>All the crosses had a name written in white; but
there were other names that were not even written on a
piece of wood,&mdash;a broken branch of a tree, stuck in the
ground, with an envelope tied around it&mdash;such tombstones
as that were to be seen there!</p>

<p>On the left, where they were digging a trench for
a third row of crosses, the workman's shovel threw
black dirt into the air, which fell upon the white earth
around. Profound silence, the deaf silence of the snow,
enveloped everything, and but two sounds could be
heard; the dull sound made by the clods of earth and
the heavy sound of regular footsteps; an old priest
who was waiting there, his head enveloped in a black
cowl, dressed in a black gown and stole, and with a
dirty, yellow surplice, was trying to keep himself warm
by stamping his great galoches on the pavement of the
high road, in front of the crosses.</p>

<p>Such was the common ditch in those days. That
tract of land, those crosses and that priest said this:
"Here sleeps the Death of the common people; this is
the poor man's end!"</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p>O Paris! thou art the heart of the world, thou art the
great city of humanity, the great city of charity and
brotherly love! Thou hast kindly intentions, old-fashioned
habits of compassion, theatres that give alms.
The poor man is thy citizen as well as the rich man.
Thy churches speak of Jesus Christ; thy laws speak of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_382" id="Page_382">[382]</a></span>
equality; thy newspapers speak of progress; all thy governments
speak of the common people; and this is where
thou castest those who die in thy service, those who kill
themselves ministering to thy luxury, those who perish
in the noisome odors of thy factories, those who have
sweated their lives away working for thee, giving thee
thy prosperity, thy pleasures, thy splendors, those who
have furnished thy animation and thy noise, those who
have lengthened with the links of their lives the chain
of thy duration as a capital, those who have been the
crowd in thy streets and the common people of thy
grandeur. Each of thy cemeteries has a like shameful
corner, hidden in the angle of a wall, where thou makest
haste to bury them, and where thou castest dirt upon
them in such stingy clods, that one can see the ends of
their coffins protruding! One would say that thy
charity stops with their last breath, that thy only free
gift is the bed whereon they suffer, and that, when the
hospital can do no more for them, thou, who art so vast
and so superb, hast no place for them! Thou dost heap
them up, crowd them together and mingle them in
death, as thou didst mingle them in the death-agony
beneath the sheets of thy hospitals a hundred years
since! As late as yesterday thou hadst only that priest
on sentry duty, to throw a drop of paltry holy water on
every comer: not the briefest prayer! Even that symbol
of decency was lacking: God could not be disturbed
for so small a matter! And what the priest blesses is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_383" id="Page_383">[383]</a></span>
always the same thing: a trench in which the pine boxes
strike against one another, where the dead enjoy no
privacy! Corruption there is common to all; no one
has his own, but each one has that of all the rest: the
worms are owned promiscuously! In the devouring soil
a Montfaucon hastens to make way for the Catacombs.
For the dead here have no more time than room to rot
in: the earth is taken from them before it has finished
with them! before their bones have assumed the color
and the ancient appearance, so to speak, of stone,
before the passing years have effaced the last trace of
humanity and the memory of a body! The excavation
is renewed when the earth is still themselves, when they
are the damp soil in which the mattock is buried. The
earth is loaned to them, you say? But it does not even
confine the odor of death! In summer, the wind that
passes over this scarcely-covered human charnel-house
wafts the unholy miasma to the city of the living. In
the scorching days of August the keepers deny admission
to the place: there are flies that bear upon them
the poison of the carrion, pestilential flies whose sting is
deadly!</p>

<hr class="hr2" />

<p>Mademoiselle arrived at this spot after passing the
wall that separates the lots sold in perpetuity from those
sold temporarily only. Following the directions given
her by a keeper, she walked along between the further
line of crosses and the newly-opened trench. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_384" id="Page_384">[384]</a></span>
there she made her way over buried wreaths, over the
snowy pall, to a hole where the trench began. It was
covered over with old rotten planks and a sheet of
oxidized zinc on which a workman had thrown his blue
blouse. The earth sloped away behind them to the
bottom of the trench, where could be seen the sinister
outlines of three wooden coffins: there were one large
one and two smaller ones just behind. The crosses of
the past week, of the day before, of two days before,
extended in a line down the slope; they glided along,
plunged suddenly downward, and seemed to be taking
long strides as if they were in danger of being carried
over a precipice.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle began to ascend the path by these
crosses, spelling out the dates and searching for the
names with her wretched eyes. She reached the crosses
of the 8th of November: that was the day before her
maid's death, and Germinie should be close by. There
were five crosses of the 9th of November, five crosses
huddled close together: Germinie was not in the crush.
Mademoiselle de Varandeuil went a little farther on,
to the crosses of the 10th, then to those of the 11th,
then to those of the 12th. She returned to the 8th,
and looked carefully around in all directions: there
was nothing, absolutely nothing,&mdash;Germinie had been
buried without a cross! Not even a bit of wood had
been placed in the ground by which to identify her
grave!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_385" id="Page_385">[385]</a></span></p>

<p>At last the old lady dropped on her knees in the
snow, between two crosses, one of which bore the date
of the 9th and the other of the 10th of November.
All that remained of Germinie should be almost in that
spot. That ill-defined space was her ill-defined grave.
To pray over her body it was necessary to pray at random
between two dates,&mdash;as if the poor girl's destiny
had decreed that there should be no more room on
earth for her body than for her heart!</p>
